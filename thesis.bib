abstract = {We outline a general coalescent framework for using genotype data in linkage disequilibrium-based mapping studies. Our approach unifies two main goals of gene mapping that have generally been treated separately in the past: detecting association (i.e., significance testing) and estimating the location of the causative variation. To tackle the problem, we separate the inference into two stages. First, we use Markov chain Monte Carlo to sample from the posterior distribution of coalescent genealogies of all the sampled chromosomes without regard to phenotype. Then, averaging across genealogies, we estimate the likelihood of the phenotype data under various models for mutation and penetrance at an unobserved disease locus. The essential signal that these models look for is that in the presence of disease susceptibility variants in a region, there is nonrandom clustering of the chromosomes on the tree according to phenotype. The extent of nonrandom clustering is captured by the likelihood and can be used to construct significance tests or Bayesian posterior distributions for location. A novelty of our framework is that it can naturally accommodate quantitative data. We describe applications of the method to simulated data and to data from a Mendelian locus (CFTR, responsible for cystic fibrosis) and from a proposed complex trait locus (calpain-10, implicated in type 2 diabetes).},

abstract = {Cowpea is an important tropical crop. It provides a large proportion of the food resource for the African human population and their livestock. The yield and quality of cowpea have been dramatically improved through traditional breeding strategies for the past few decades. However, reports of heritability estimates for early growth of cowpea are rare. We designed a simple experiment to estimate the broad-sense heritability of early growth. We randomly selected 15 cowpea varieties among a total of 5000 cowpea accessions maintained in the cowpea breeding facility at the University of California, Riverside to examine the genetic determination of early growth of cowpea (measured as the height at day five after seeding). The estimated broad-sense heritability on the individual plant basis is 0.2190. However, the corresponding estimate on the plant mean basis (average of four plants) is 0.5198, which is very high for a quantitative trait. The high heritability may explain why traditional breeding for cowpea growth is so effective. Since the design of experiment and method of data analysis are novel, this report can serve as an educational note for students in the area of quantitative genetics and plant breeding.},

abstract = {Empirical studies suggest that the effect sizes of individual causal risk alleles underlying complex genetic diseases are small, with most genotype relative risks in the range of 1.1-2.0. Although the increased risk of disease for a carrier is small for any single locus, knowledge of multiple-risk alleles throughout the genome could allow the identification of individuals that are at high risk. In this study, we investigate the number and effect size of risk loci that underlie complex disease constrained by the disease parameters of prevalence and heritability. Then we quantify the value of prediction of genetic risk to disease using a range of realistic combinations of the number, size, and distribution of risk effects that underlie complex diseases. We propose an approach to assess the genetic risk of a disease in healthy individuals, based on dense genome-wide SNP panels. We test this approach using simulation. When the number of loci contributing to the disease is >50, a large case-control study is needed to identify a set of risk loci for use in predicting the disease risk of healthy people not included in the case-control study. For diseases controlled by 1000 loci of mean relative risk of only 1.04, a case-control study with 10,000 cases and controls can lead to selection of approximately 75 loci that explain >50\% of the genetic variance. The 5\% of people with the highest predicted risk are three to seven times more likely to suffer the disease than the population average, depending on heritability and disease prevalence. Whether an individual with known genetic risk develops the disease depends on known and unknown environmental factors.},

The standard definition applies to two alleles in the same gamete, and it can be regarded as the covariance of indicator variables for the states of those two alleles. The corresponding correlation coefficient rho is the parameter that arises naturally in discussions of tests of association between markers and genetic diseases. A general treatment of association tests makes use of the additive and nonadditive components of variance for the disease gene. In almost all expressions that describe the behavior of association tests, additive variance components are modified by the squared correlation coefficient rho2 and the nonadditive variance components by rho4, suggesting that nonadditive components have less influence than additive components on association tests.},

abstract = {Gene-gene interactions have long been recognized to be fundamentally important for understanding genetic causes of complex disease traits. At present, identifying gene-gene interactions from genome-wide case-control studies is computationally and methodologically challenging. In this paper, we introduce a simple but powerful method, named "BOolean Operation-based Screening and Testing" (BOOST). For the discovery of unknown gene-gene interactions that underlie complex diseases, BOOST allows examination of all pairwise interactions in genome-wide case-control studies in a remarkably fast manner. We have carried out interaction analyses on seven data sets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC). Each analysis took less than 60 hr to completely evaluate all pairs of roughly 360,000 SNPs on a standard 3.0 GHz desktop with 4G memory running the Windows XP system. The interaction patterns identified from the type 1 diabetes data set display significant difference from those identified from the rheumatoid arthritis data set, although both data sets share a very similar hit region in the WTCCC report. BOOST has also identified some disease-associated interactions between genes in the major histocompatibility complex region in the type 1 diabetes data set. We believe that our method can serve as a computationally and statistically useful tool in the coming era of large-scale interaction mapping in genome-wide case-control studies.},

abstract = {A general model of the functional constraints on the rate and direction of phenotypic evolution is developed using a decomposition of the Lande-Arnold model of multivariate phenotypic evolution. The important feature of the model is the F matrix of performance coefficients reflecting the causal relationship between morphophysiological (m-p) and functional performance traits. The structure of F, which reflects the functional architecture of the organism, constrains the shape of the adaptive landscape and thus the rate and direction of m-p trait evolution. The rate of m-p trait evolution is a function of the pattern of coefficients in a row of F. The sums and variances of these rows are related to current concepts of evolvability. The direction of m-p trait evolution through m-p trait space is a function of the functional covariances among m-p traits. The functional covariance between a pair of m-p traits is a measure of how much the traits function together and is computed as the covariance between rows of F. Finally, it is shown that genetic covariances between m-p traits and performance traits are a function of the F matrix, but a G matrix that includes these covariances cannot be used to model functional constraints effectively.},

abstract = {Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in humans and great apes, which have lost hepatic uricase activity, leading to uniquely high serum uric acid concentrations (200-500 microM) compared with other mammals (3-120 microM). About 70\% of daily urate disposal occurs via the kidneys, and in 5-25\% of the human population, impaired renal excretion leads to hyperuricemia. About 10\% of people with hyperuricemia develop gout, an inflammatory arthritis that results from deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint. We have identified genetic variants within a transporter gene, SLC2A9, that explain 1.7-5.3\% of the variance in serum uric acid concentrations, following a genome-wide association scan in a Croatian population sample. SLC2A9 variants were also associated with low fractional excretion of uric acid and/or gout in UK, Croatian and German population samples. SLC2A9 is a known fructose transporter, and we now show that it has strong uric acid transport activity in Xenopus laevis oocytes.},

abstract = {Height has been used for more than a century as a model by which to understand quantitative genetic variation in humans. We report that the entire genome appears to contribute to its additive genetic variance. We used genotypes and phenotypes of 11,214 sibling pairs from three countries to partition additive genetic variance across the genome. Using genome scans to estimate the proportion of the genomes of each chromosome from siblings that were identical by descent, we estimated the heritability of height contributed by each of the 22 autosomes and the X chromosome. We show that additive genetic variance is spread across multiple chromosomes and that at least six chromosomes (i.e., 3, 4, 8, 15, 17, and 18) are responsible for the observed variation. Indeed, the data are not inconsistent with a uniform spread of trait loci throughout the genome. Our estimate of the variance explained by a chromosome is correlated with the number of times suggestive or significant linkage with height has been reported for that chromosome. Variance due to dominance was not significant but was difficult to assess because of the high sampling correlation between additive and dominance components. Results were consistent with the absence of any large between-chromosome epistatic effects. Notwithstanding the proposed architecture of complex traits that involves widespread gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, our results suggest that variation in height in humans can be explained by many loci distributed over all autosomes, with an additive mode of gene action.},

The QTLs contribute to variation in 97 traits, including models of human disease (asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and anxiety) as well as immunological, biochemical and hematological phenotypes. The genetic architecture of almost all phenotypes was complex, with many loci each contributing a small proportion to the total variance.

We show that racial classifications are inadequate descriptors of the distribution of genetic variation in our species. Although populations do cluster by broad geographic regions, which generally correspond to socially recognized races, the distribution of genetic variation is quasicontinuous in clinal patterns related to geography. The broad global pattern reflects the accumulation of genetic drift associated with a recent African origin of modern humans, followed by expansion out of Africa and across the rest of the globe. Because disease genes may be geographically restricted due to mutation, genetic drift, migration and natural selection, knowledge of individual ancestry will be important for biomedical studies. Identifiers based on race will often be insufficient.},

abstract = {A method for estimating a graphical model to describe allelic associations between genetic loci is extended to use diploid genotypes rather than haploid data. It also provides haplotype frequency estimates, estimates of phase for sampled individuals, allows for missing or partial information, genotyping errors, and arbitrary penetrance functions. A data set of 688 unrelated individuals genotyped on 25 genetic loci is used to illustrate haplotype frequency estimation. The frequencies obtained are shown to be similar to those obtained by the PHASE program. We also illustrate how putative loci for traits can be included in the analysis in order to detect allele-phenotype associations. Haplotype reconstruction is illustrated on a standard set of 40 male X-chromosome haplotypes, randomly paired to simulate diploid genotype data. The novel method is shown to be comparable to most existing ones, though the PHASE method does consistently better on this problem. The graphical model approach is shown to have some advantages in terms of tractability and can be used to select informative subsets of loci and to map loci influencing phenotypes.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 x 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.},

A genome-wide scan of large, high-risk pedigrees from Utah has provided evidence for linkage to a locus on chromosome 17p. We carried out positional cloning and mutation screening within the refined interval, identifying a gene, ELAC2, harboring mutations (including a frameshift and a nonconservative missense change) that segregate with prostate cancer in two pedigrees. In addition, two common missense variants in the gene are associated with the occurrence of prostate cancer. ELAC2 is a member of an uncharacterized gene family predicted to encode a metal-dependent hydrolase domain that is conserved among eukaryotes, archaebacteria and eubacteria. The gene product bears amino acid sequence similarity to two better understood protein families, namely the PSO2 (SNM1) DNA interstrand crosslink repair proteins and the 73-kD subunit of mRNA 3' end cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF73).},

abstract = {Since the early descriptions of sickle cell anemia, it has been clear that genotype at a single locus rarely completely predicts phenotype. This paper reviews explanations for phenotypic variability in some monogenic diseases. In cystic fibrosis, there is strong correlation between genotype and pancreatic phenotype but only weak association with respiratory phenotype, possibly due to differential inheritance of alleles at loci controlling susceptibility to respiratory infection. In addition, disease mutations have been shown to have more or less severe effect, depending on other variation within the cystic fibrosis gene. In phenylketonuria, genotype at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus appears to explain the biochemical phenotype, but not the intellectual status. There may be genetically determined variation in flux through the minor metabolic pathways for phenylalanine, influencing levels of alternative metabolites involved in mental development. Phenotypic discordance in sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia has been associated with the co-inheritance of genes for hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. A mouse locus has been identified that influences tumour number in mice with the multiple intestinal neoplasia gene.

abstract = {Apolipoprotein E (apoE), a plasma apolipoprotein that plays a central role in lipoprotein metabolism, is localized in the senile plaques, congophilic angiopathy, and neurofibrillary tangles of Alzheimer disease. Late-onset familial and sporadic Alzheimer disease patients have an increased frequency of one of the three common apoE alleles, epsilon 4, suggesting apoE4 is associated with increased susceptibility to disease. To follow up on this suggestion, we compared the binding of synthetic amyloid beta (beta/A4) peptide to purified apoE4 and apoE3, the most common isoform. Both isoforms bound synthetic beta/A4 peptide, the primary constituent of the plaque and angiopathy, forming a complex that resisted dissociation by boiling in SDS. Oxygen-mediated complex formation was implicated because binding was increased in oxygenated buffer, reduced in nitrogen-purged buffer, and prevented by reduction with dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol. Binding of beta/A4 peptide was saturable at 10(-4) M peptide and required residues 12-28. Examination of apoE fragments revealed that residues 244-272 are critical for complex formation. Both oxidized apoE4 and apoE3 bound beta/A4 peptide; however, binding to apoE4 was observed in minutes, whereas binding to apoE3 required hours. In addition, apoE4 did not bind beta/A4 peptide at pH < 6.6, whereas apoE3 bound beta/A4 peptide from pH 7.6 to 4.6. Together these results indicate differences in the two isoforms in complexing with the beta/A4 peptide. Binding of beta/A4 peptide by oxidized apoE may determine the sequestration or targeting of either apoE or beta/A4 peptide, and isoform-specific differences in apoE binding or oxidation may be involved in the pathogenesis of the intra- and extracellular lesions of Alzheimer disease.},

abstract = {This report describes current methods for selection of informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using data from a dense network of SNPs that have been genotyped in a relatively small panel of subjects. We discuss the following issues: (1) Optimal selection of SNPs based upon maximizing either the predictability of unmeasured SNPs or the predictability of SNP haplotypes as selection criteria. (2) The dependence of the performance of tag SNP selection methods upon the density of SNP markers genotyped for the purpose of haplotype discovery and tag SNP selection. (3) The likely power of case-control studies to detect the influence upon disease risk of common disease-causing variants in candidate genes in a haplotype-based analysis. We propose a quasi-empirical approach towards evaluating the power of large studies with this calculation based upon the SNP genotype and haplotype frequencies estimated in a haplotype discovery panel. In this calculation, each common SNP in turn is treated as a potential unmeasured causal variant and subjected to a correlation analysis using the remaining SNPs. We use a small portion of the HapMap ENCODE data (488 common SNPs genotyped over approximately a 500 kb region of chromosome 2) as an illustrative example of this approach towards power evaluation.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have created a paradigm shift in discovering genetic associations for common diseases and phenotypes, but it is unclear whether the thousands of candidate genetic association studies performed in the pre-GWAS era had found any reliable associations for common diseases and phenotypes. We aimed to systematically evaluate whether loci proposed to harbor candidate associations before the advent of GWASs are replicated in GWASs. The GWAS data published through August, 2008 and included in the NHGRI catalog were screened and variants in candidate loci were selected on the basis of statistical significance (P<0.05) to create a list of independent, non-redundant associations. Altogether, 159 articles on GWASs were evaluated, 100 of which addressed past proposed candidate loci. A total of 291 independent, nominally significant (P<0.05) candidate gene associations were assembled after keeping only the SNP with lowest P-value for each locus and each phenotype; 108 of those had P<10(-3) for association and 41 had P<10(-7). A total of 22 of these 41 candidate gene associations pertained to binary phenotypes with a median odds ratio=2.91 (IQR: 1.82-4.6) and median minor allele frequency=0.17 (IQR: 0.12-0.29) in Caucasians; for comparison, 60 new associations of binary outcomes with P<10(-7) discovered in the same GWASs had much smaller effects (median odds ratio 1.30, IQR: 1.18-1.58) and modestly larger minor allele frequencies (median 0.27, IQR: 0.15-0.43). Overall, few of the numerous genetic associations proposed in the candidate gene era have been replicated in GWASs, but those that have been conclusively replicated have large genetic effects that should not be discarded.},

@article{Sinnott-Armstrong2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human geneticists are now capable of measuring more than one million DNA sequence variations from across the human genome. The new challenge is to develop computationally feasible methods capable of analyzing these data for associations with common human disease, particularly in the context of epistasis. Epistasis describes the situation where multiple genes interact in a complex non-linear manner to determine an individual's disease risk and is thought to be ubiquitous for common diseases. Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) is an algorithm capable of detecting epistasis. An exhaustive analysis with MDR is often computationally expensive, particularly for high order interactions. This challenge has previously been met with parallel computation and expensive hardware. The option we examine here exploits commodity hardware designed for computer graphics. In modern computers Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have more memory bandwidth and computational capability than Central Processing Units (CPUs) and are well suited to this problem. Advances in the video game industry have led to an economy of scale creating a situation where these powerful components are readily available at very low cost. Here we implement and evaluate the performance of the MDR algorithm on GPUs. Of primary interest are the time required for an epistasis analysis and the price to performance ratio of available solutions. FINDINGS: We found that using MDR on GPUs consistently increased performance per machine over both a feature rich Java software package and a C++ cluster implementation. The performance of a GPU workstation running a GPU implementation reduces computation time by a factor of 160 compared to an 8-core workstation running the Java implementation on CPUs. This GPU workstation performs similarly to 150 cores running an optimized C++ implementation on a Beowulf cluster. Furthermore this GPU system provides extremely cost effective performance while leaving the CPU available for other tasks. The GPU workstation containing three GPUs costs \$2000 while obtaining similar performance on a Beowulf cluster requires 150 CPU cores which, including the added infrastructure and support cost of the cluster system, cost approximately \$82,500. CONCLUSION: Graphics hardware based computing provides a cost effective means to perform genetic analysis of epistasis using MDR on large datasets without the infrastructure of a computing cluster.},

abstract = {Most species maintain abundant genetic variation and experience a range of environmental conditions, yet phenotypic variation is low. That is, development is robust to changes in genotype and environment. It has been claimed that this robustness, termed canalization, evolves because of long-term natural selection for optimal phenotypes. We show that the developmental process, here modeled as a network of interacting transcriptional regulators, constrains the genetic system to produce canalization, even without selection toward an optimum. The extent of canalization, measured as the insensitivity to mutation of a network's equilibrium state, depends on the complexity of the network, such that more highly connected networks evolve to be more canalized. We argue that canalization may be an inevitable consequence of complex developmental\&\#x02013;genetic processes and thus requires no explanation in terms of evolution to suppress phenotypic variation.},

The underlying Markov chain is irreducible for most traits determined by a diallelic locus. For a given pedigree and a known genetic model, the Gibbs sampler can be used to obtain good estimates of the posterior distribution of genotypes given the observed data. The areas of pedigree analysis to which such an approach would be most directly relevant include genetic counselling and selective animal breeding, together with questions about ancestral genotypes and the ancestral paths of rare alleles. The method is illustrated by tracing the ancestral paths of a rare allele in a simple diallelic system on a highly complex Eskimo pedigree.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have proven to be a successful approach for helping unravel the genetic basis of complex genetic diseases. However, the identified associations are not well suited for disease prediction, and only a modest portion of the heritability can be explained for most diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes or Crohn's disease. This may partly be due to the low power of standard statistical approaches to detect gene-gene and gene-environment interactions when small marginal effects are present. A promising alternative is Random Forests, which have already been successfully applied in candidate gene analyses. Important single nucleotide polymorphisms are detected by permutation importance measures. To this day, the application to GWA data was highly cumbersome with existing implementations because of the high computational burden. RESULTS: Here, we present the new freely available software package Random Jungle (RJ), which facilitates the rapid analysis of GWA data. The program yields valid results and computes up to 159 times faster than the fastest alternative implementation, while still maintaining all options of other programs. Specifically, it offers the different permutation importance measures available. It includes new options such as the backward elimination method. We illustrate the application of RJ to a GWA of Crohn's disease. The most important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) validate recent findings in the literature and reveal potential interactions.

However, extensions and applications of LD mapping approaches to more complex human quantitative traits have not been straightforward. In this article, we consider the analysis of biallelic DNA marker loci and human quantitative trait loci in settings that involve sampling individuals from opposite ends of the trait distribution. The purpose of this sampling strategy is to enrich samples for individuals likely to possess (and not possess) trait-influencing alleles. Simple statistical models for detecting LD between a trait-influencing allele and neighboring marker alleles are derived that make use of this sampling scheme. The power of the proposed method is investigated analytically for some hypothetical gene-effect scenarios. Our studies indicate that LD mapping of loci influencing human quantitative trait variation should be possible in certain settings. Finally, we consider possible extensions of the proposed methods, as well as areas for further consideration and improvement.},

This report reviews the motivation of using haplotypes for the study of the genetic basis of human traits, ranging from biologic function, to statistical power advantages of haplotypes, to linkage disequilibrium fine-mapping. Recent developments of regression models for haplotype analyses are reviewed, offering a synthesis of current methods, as well as their limitations and areas that require further research. Regression models provide significant advantages, such as the ability to control for non-genetic covariates, the effects of the haplotypes can be modeled, step-wise selection can be used to screen for a subset of markers that explain most of the association, haplotype x environment interactions can be evaluated, and regression diagnostics are well developed. Despite these strengths, the current regression methods tend to lack the sophisticated population genetic perspectives offered by coalescent and other similar approaches. Future work that links regression methods with population genetic models may prove beneficial.},

abstract = {More than 1,000 mutations have been identified in the cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane regulator (CFTR) disease gene. The impact of these mutations on the protein and the wide spectrum of CF phenotypes prompted a series of Genotype-Phenotype correlation studies. The CFTR genotype is invariably correlated with pancreatic status-in about 85\% of cases with pancreatic insufficiency and in about 15\% of cases with pancreatic sufficiency. The correlations between the CFTR genotype and pulmonary, liver, and gastrointestinal expression are debatable. The heterogeneous phenotype in CF patients bearing the same genotype or homozygotes for nonsense mutations implicated environmental and/or genetic factors in the disease. However, the discordant phenotype observed in CF siblings argued against a major role of environmental factors and suggested that genes other than CFTR modulate the CF phenotype. A locus that modulates gastrointestinal expression was identified in mice and subsequently in humans. By analyzing nine CF patients discordant for meconium ileus we were able to show that this locus had a dominant effect. Moreover, in a collaborative study we found a higher rate of polymorphisms in beta-defensin genes 1 and 2 in CF patients and in controls. In another multicenter study mutations in alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) and mannose binding lectin genes were found to be independent risk factors for liver disease in CF patients. The body of evidence available suggests that the variegated CF phenotype results from complex interactions between numerous gene products.},

abstract = {We describe a map of 1.42 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distributed throughout the human genome, providing an average density on available sequence of one SNP every 1.9 kilobases. These SNPs were primarily discovered by two projects: The SNP Consortium and the analysis of clone overlaps by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium. The map integrates all publicly available SNPs with described genes and other genomic features. We estimate that 60,000 SNPs fall within exon (coding and untranslated regions), and 85\% of exons are within 5 kb of the nearest SNP. Nucleotide diversity varies greatly across the genome, in a manner broadly consistent with a standard population genetic model of human history. This high-density SNP map provides a public resource for defining haplotype variation across the genome, and should help to identify biomedically important genes for diagnosis and therapy.},

abstract = {Refining phenotypes for the study of neuropsychiatric disorders is of paramount importance in neuroscience. Poor phenotype definition provides the greatest obstacle for making progress in disorders like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and autism. Using freely available informatics tools developed by the Consortium for Neuropsychiatric Phenomics (CNP), we provide a framework for defining and refining latent constructs used in neuroscience research and then apply this strategy to review known genetic contributions to memory and intelligence in healthy individuals. This approach can help us begin to build multi-level phenotype models that express the interactions between constructs necessary to understand complex neuropsychiatric diseases. These results are available online through the http://www.phenowiki.org database. Further work needs to be done in order to provide consensus-building applications for the broadly defined constructs used in neuroscience research.},

abstract = {The twin method has been criticised for its alleged non-generalisability. When population parameters of intellectual abilities are estimated from a twin sample, critics point to the twin-singleton differences in intrauterine and family environments. These differences are suggested to lead to suboptimal cognitive development in twins. Although previous studies have reported twin-singleton differences in intelligence, these studies had two major drawbacks: they tested young twins, and twins were compared with (genetically) unrelated singletons. To test accurately whether twin-singleton differences in intelligence exist, a group of adult twins and their non-twin siblings were administered the Dutch WAIS-III. The group was large enough to detect twin-singleton differences of magnitudes reported in earlier investigations. The data were analysed using maximum likelihood model fitting. No evidence of differences between adult twins and their non-twin siblings on cognitive performance was found. It is concluded that twin studies provide reliable estimates of heritabilities of intellectual abilities which can be generalised to the singleton population.},

abstract = {Epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones might be crucial for understanding the molecular basis of complex phenotypes. One reason for this is that epigenetic factors are sometimes malleable and plastic enough to react to cues from the external and internal environments. Such induced epigenetic changes can be solidified and propagated during cell division, resulting in permanent maintenance of the acquired phenotype. In addition, the finding that there is partial epigenetic stability in somatic and germline cells allows insight into the molecular mechanisms of heritability. Epigenetics can provide a new framework for the search of aetiological factors in complex traits and diseases.},

@article{Peng2007,
abstract = {The success of mapping genes involved in complex diseases, using association or linkage disequilibrium methods, depends heavily on the number and frequency of susceptibility alleles of these genes. These methods will be economically and statistically feasible if common diseases are usually influenced by one or a few susceptibility alleles at each locus (common disease-common variant, CDCV, hypothesis), but not so if there is a high degree of allelic heterogeneity. Here, we use forward-time population simulations to investigate the impact of various genetic and demographic factors on the allelic spectra of human diseases, on the basis of two models proposed by Reich and Lander and by Pritchard. Factors considered are more complex demographies, a finite-allele mutation model, population structure and migration, and interaction between disease susceptibility loci. The conclusion is that the CDCV hypothesis holds and that the phenomenon is caused by transient effects of demography (population expansion). As a result, we devise a multilocus generalization of the Reich and Lander model and demonstrate how interaction between loci with respect to their response to selection may lead to complex effects. We discuss the implications for mapping of complex diseases.},

We discuss an approach to studying population structure (principal components analysis) that was first applied to genetic data by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues. We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general "phase change" phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

We propose statistical power calculations for future GWASs using estimated distributions of effect sizes. Using reported GWAS findings for height, Crohn's disease and breast, prostate and colorectal (BPC) cancers, we determine that each of these traits is likely to harbor additional loci within the spectrum of low-penetrance common variants. These loci, which can be identified from sufficiently powerful GWASs, together could explain at least 15-20\% of the known heritability of these traits. However, for BPC cancers, which have modest familial aggregation, our analysis suggests that risk models based on common variants alone will have modest discriminatory power (63.5\% area under curve), even with new discoveries.},

abstract = {Genetic redundancy means that two or more genes are performing the same function and that inactivation of one of these genes has little or no effect on the biological phenotype. Redundancy seems to be widespread in genomes of higher organisms. Examples of apparently redundant genes come from numerous studies of developmental biology, immunology, neurobiology and the cell cycle. Yet there is a problem: genes encoding functional proteins must be under selection pressure. If a gene was truly redundant then it would not be protected against the accumulation of deleterious mutations. A widespread view is therefore that such redundancy cannot be evolutionarily stable. Here we develop a simple genetic model to analyse selection pressures acting on redundant genes. We present four cases that can explain why genetic redundancy is common. In three cases, redundancy is even evolutionarily stable. Our theory provides a framework for exploring the evolution of genetic organization.},

abstract = {The interpretation of the results of large association studies encompassing much or all of the human genome faces the fundamental statistical problem that a correspondingly large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms markers will be spuriously flagged as significant. A common method of dealing with these false positives is to raise the significance level for the individual tests for association of each marker. Any such adjustment for multiple testing is ultimately based on a more or less precise estimate for the actual overall type I error probability. We estimate this probability for association tests for correlated markers and show that it depends in a nonlinear way on the significance level for the individual tests. This dependence of the effective number of tests is not taken into account by existing multiple-testing corrections, leading to widely overestimated results. We demonstrate a simple correction for multiple testing, which can easily be calculated from the pairwise correlation and gives far more realistic estimates for the effective number of tests than previous formulae. The calculation is considerably faster than with other methods and hence applicable on a genome-wide scale. The efficacy of our method is shown on a constructed example with highly correlated markers as well as on real data sets, including a full genome scan where a conservative estimate only 8\% above the permutation estimate is obtained in about 1\% of computation time. As the calculation is based on pairwise correlations between markers, it can be performed at the stage of study design using public databases.},

Milk pools prepared from high and low daughters of each of seven sires were genotyped for 138 dinucleotide microsatellites. Shadow-corrected estimates of sire allele frequencies were compared between high and low pools. An adjusted false discovery rate (FDR) method was employed to calculate experimentwise significance levels and empirical power. Significant associations with milk protein percentage were found for 61 of the markers (adjusted FDR = 0.10; estimated power, 0.68). The significant markers appear to be linked to 19--28 QTL. Mean allele substitution effects of the putative QTL averaged 0.016 (0.009--0.028) in units of the within-sire family standard deviation of EBVP\% and summed to 0.460 EBVP\%. Overall QTL heterozygosity was 0.40. The identified QTL appear to account for all of the variation in EBVP\% in the population. Through use of selective DNA pooling, 4400 pool data points provided the statistical power of 600,000 individual data points.},

Despite easy access to commercial personal genetics services, our knowledge of the genetic architecture of common diseases is still very limited and has not yet fulfilled the promise of accurately predicting most people at risk. This is partly because of the complexity of the mapping relationship between genotype and phenotype that is a consequence of epistasis (gene-gene interaction) and other phenomena such as gene-environment interaction and locus heterogeneity. Unfortunately, these aspects of genetic architecture have not been addressed in most of the genetic association studies that provide the knowledge base for interpreting large-scale genetic association results. We provide here an introductory review of how epistasis can affect human health and disease and how it can be detected in population-based studies. We provide some thoughts on the implications of epistasis for personal genetics and some recommendations for improving personal genetics in light of this complexity.},

abstract = {Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from the brains of C57BL/6J (B6), DBA/2J (D2), and F1 hybrid mice (B6 X D2) of 16-17 days of age. The yield of polysomal RNA, both poly(A)+ and poly(A)-, from the three strains of mice was comparable. When translated in vitro in a reticulocyte lysate system, the mRNA preparations had the same efficiency with respect to stimulation of amino acid incorporation into protein. However, a significant heterotic effect was seen for the production of myelin basic protein (MBP) by the mRNA from the F1 mice. That is, the fraction of protein synthesized as MBP was greater for the F1 hybrid than for either parental strain. The distribution of the form of MBPs was not different among the three strains. We therefore believe that heterosis for brain MBP content in the F1 hybrid may be regulated at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level.},

abstract = {The global health impact of malaria is enormous, with an estimated 300-500 million clinical cases and 1 million annual deaths. In humans, initial susceptibility to infection with Plasmodium species, disease severity and ultimate outcome of malaria (self-healing or lethal) are under complex genetic control. Alleles associated with sickle cell anemia, beta-thalassemia and deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase have a protective effect against malaria and may have been retained by positive selection in areas of endemic malaria. Likewise, genetic variations in erythrocyte antigens and levels of host cytokines affect type and severity of disease. A mouse model of infection with Plasmodium chabaudi was used to study the genetic component of malaria susceptibility. Segregation analyses in informative F2 crosses derived from resistant C57BL/6J and susceptible A/J, C3H and SJL strains using extent of blood stage replication of the parasite and survival as traits mapped three P. chabaudi resistance (Char) loci on chromosomes 9 (Char1), 8 (Char2) and 17 (Char3, MHC-linked). Recombinant congenic strains AcB55 and AcB61 are unusually resistant to malaria despite carrying susceptibility alleles at Char1 and Char2. Malaria resistance in AcB55 and AcB61 is associated with splenomegaly and constitutive reticulocytosis, is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and is controlled by a locus on chromosome 3 (Char4). Sequencing of candidate genes from the Char4 region identified a loss-of-function mutation (269T-->A, resulting in the amino acid substitution I90N) in the pyruvate kinase gene (Pklr) that underlies the malaria resistance in AcB55 and AcB61. These results suggest that pyruvate kinase deficiency may similarly protect humans against malaria.},

abstract = {An efficient testing strategy called the "focused interaction testing framework" (FITF) was developed to identify susceptibility genes involved in epistatic interactions for case-control studies of candidate genes. In the FITF approach, likelihood-ratio tests are performed in stages that increase in the order of interaction considered. Joint tests of main effects and interactions are performed conditional on significant lower-order effects. A reduction in the number of tests performed is achieved by prescreening gene combinations with a goodness-of-fit chi2 statistic that depends on association among candidate genes in the pooled case-control group. Multiple testing is accounted for by controlling false-discovery rates. Simulation analysis demonstrated that the FITF approach is more powerful than marginal tests of candidate genes. FITF also outperformed multifactor dimensionality reduction when interactions involved additive, dominant, or recessive genes. In an application to asthma case-control data from the Children's Health Study, FITF identified a significant multilocus effect between the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) reduced:quinone oxidoreductase gene (NQO1), myeloperoxidase gene (MPO), and catalase gene (CAT) (unadjusted P = .00026), three genes that are involved in the oxidative stress pathway. In an independent data set consisting primarily of African American and Asian American children, these three genes also showed a significant association with asthma status (P = .0008).},

abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of approximately 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size N(e) = 100, the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

abstract = {Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is of great interest for gene mapping and the study of population history. We propose a multilocus model for LD, based on the decay of haplotype sharing (DHS). The DHS model is most appropriate when the LD in which one is interested is due to the introduction of a variant on an ancestral haplotype, with recombinations in succeeding generations resulting in preservation of only a small region of the ancestral haplotype around the variant. This is generally the scenario of interest for gene mapping by LD. The DHS parameter is a measure of LD that can be interpreted as the expected genetic distance to which the ancestral haplotype is preserved, or, equivalently, 1/(time in generations to the ancestral haplotype). The method allows for multiple origins of alleles and for mutations, and it takes into account missing observations and ambiguities in haplotype determination, via a hidden Markov model. Whereas most commonly used measures of LD apply to pairs of loci, the DHS measure is designed for application to the densely mapped haplotype data that are increasingly available. The DHS method explicitly models the dependence among multiple tightly linked loci on a chromosome. When the assumptions about population structure are sufficiently tractable, the estimate of LD is obtained by maximum likelihood. For more-complicated models of population history, we find means and covariances based on the model and solve a quasi-score estimating equation. Simulations show that this approach works extremely well both for estimation of LD and for fine mapping. We apply the DHS method to published data sets for cystic fibrosis and progressive myoclonus epilepsy.},

abstract = {The 'Mendelian randomization' approach uses genotype as an instrumental variable to distinguish between causal and non-causal explanations of biomarker-disease associations. Classical methods for instrumental variable analysis are limited to linear or probit models without latent variables or missing data, rely on asymptotic approximations that are not valid for weak instruments and focus on estimation rather than hypothesis testing. We describe a Bayesian approach that overcomes these limitations, using the JAGS program to compute the log-likelihood ratio (lod score) between causal and non-causal explanations of a biomarker-disease association. To demonstrate the approach, we examined the relationship of plasma urate levels to metabolic syndrome in the ORCADES study of a Scottish population isolate, using genotype at six single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the urate transporter gene SLC2A9 as an instrumental variable. In models that allow for intra-individual variability in urate levels, the lod score favouring a non-causal over a causal explanation was 2.34. In models that do not allow for intra-individual variability, the weight of evidence against a causal explanation was weaker (lod score 1.38). We demonstrate the ability to test one of the key assumptions of instrumental variable analysis--that the effects of the instrument on outcome are mediated only through the intermediate variable--by constructing a test for residual effects of genotype on outcome, similar to the tests of 'overidentifying restrictions' developed for classical instrumental variable analysis. The Bayesian approach described here is flexible enough to deal with any instrumental variable problem, and does not rely on asymptotic approximations that may not be valid for weak instruments. The approach can easily be extended to combine information from different study designs. Statistical power calculations show that instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments will typically require combining information from moderately large cohort and cross-sectional studies of biomarkers with information from very large genetic case-control studies.},

A central challenge in this area is the development of powerful multipoint methods that can detect causal variants that have not been directly genotyped. We propose a coherent analysis framework that treats the problem as one involving missing or uncertain genotypes. Central to our approach is a model-based imputation method for inferring genotypes at observed or unobserved SNPs, leading to improved power over existing methods for multipoint association mapping. Using real genome-wide association study data, we show that our approach (i) is accurate and well calibrated, (ii) provides detailed views of associated regions that facilitate follow-up studies and (iii) can be used to validate and correct data at genotyped markers. A notable future use of our method will be to boost power by combining data from genome-wide scans that use different SNP sets.},

abstract = {Epistasis effects (gene interactions) have been increasingly recognized as important genetic factors underlying complex traits. The existence of a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provides opportunities and challenges to screen DNA variations affecting complex traits using a candidate gene analysis. In this article, four types of epistasis effects of two candidate gene SNPs with Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium (HWD) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) are considered: additive x additive, additive x dominance, dominance x additive, and dominance x dominance. The Kempthorne genetic model was chosen for its appealing genetic interpretations of the epistasis effects. The method in this study consists of extension of Kempthorne's definitions of 35 individual genetic effects to allow HWD and LD, genetic contrasts of the 35 extended individual genetic effects to define the 4 epistasis effects, and a linear model method for testing epistasis effects. Formulas to predict statistical power (as a function of contrast heritability, sample size, and type I error) and sample size (as a function of contrast heritability, type I error, and type II error) for detecting each epistasis effect were derived, and the theoretical predictions agreed well with simulation studies. The accuracy in estimating each epistasis effect and rates of false positives in the absence of all or three epistasis effects were evaluated using simulations. The method for epistasis testing can be a useful tool to understand the exact mode of epistasis, to assemble genome-wide SNPs into an epistasis network, and to assemble all SNP effects affecting a phenotype using pairwise epistasis tests.},

abstract = {Despite rapid advances in genomic technology, our ability to account for phenotypic variation using genetic information remains limited for many traits. This has unfortunately resulted in limited application of genetic data towards preventive and personalized medicine, one of the primary impetuses of genome-wide association studies. Recently, a large proportion of the "missing heritability" for human height was statistically explained by modeling thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms concurrently. However, it is currently unclear how gains in explained genetic variance will translate to the prediction of yet-to-be observed phenotypes. Using data from the Framingham Heart Study, we explore the genomic prediction of human height in training and validation samples while varying the statistical approach used, the number of SNPs included in the model, the validation scheme, and the number of subjects used to train the model. In our training datasets, we are able to explain a large proportion of the variation in height (h(2) up to 0.83, R(2) up to 0.96). However, the proportion of variance accounted for in validation samples is much smaller (ranging from 0.15 to 0.36 depending on the degree of familial information used in the training dataset). While such R(2) values vastly exceed what has been previously reported using a reduced number of pre-selected markers (<0.10), given the heritability of the trait (∼ 0.80), substantial room for improvement remains.},

abstract = {The genetic basis underlying inbreeding depression and heterosis for three grain yield components of rice was investigated in five interrelated mapping populations using a complete RFLP linkage map, replicated phenotyping, and the mixed model approach. The populations included 254 F(10) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Lemont (japonica) and Teqing (indica), two backcross (BC) and two testcross populations derived from crosses between the RILs and the parents plus two testers (Zhong413 and IR64). For the yield components, the RILs showed significant inbreeding depression and hybrid breakdown, and the BC and testcross populations showed high levels of heterosis. The average performance of the BC or testcross hybrids was largely determined by heterosis. The inbreeding depression values of individual RILs were negatively associated with the heterosis measurements of the BC or testcross hybrids. We identified many epistatic QTL pairs and a few main-effect QTL responsible for >65\% of the phenotypic variation of the yield components in each of the populations. Most epistasis occurred between complementary loci, suggesting that grain yield components were associated more with multilocus genotypes than with specific alleles at individual loci. Overdominance was also an important property of most loci associated with heterosis, particularly for panicles per plant and grains per panicle. Two independent groups of genes appeared to affect grain weight: one showing primarily nonadditive gene action explained 62.1\% of the heterotic variation of the trait, and the other exhibiting only additive gene action accounted for 28.1\% of the total trait variation of the F(1) mean values. We found no evidence suggesting that pseudo-overdominance from the repulsive linkage of completely or partially dominant QTL for yield components resulted in the overdominant QTL for grain yield. Pronounced overdominance resulting from epistasis expressed by multilocus genotypes appeared to explain the long-standing dilemma of how inbreeding depression could arise from overdominant genes.},

abstract = {It has become clear that a large proportion of functional DNA in the human genome does not code for protein. Identification of this non-coding functional sequence using comparative approaches is proving difficult and has previously been thought to require deep sequencing of multiple vertebrates. Here we introduce a new model and comparative method that, instead of nucleotide substitutions, uses the evolutionary imprint of insertions and deletions (indels) to infer the past consequences of selection. The model predicts the distribution of indels under neutrality, and shows an excellent fit to human-mouse ancestral repeat data. Across the genome, many unusually long ungapped regions are detected that are unaccounted for by the neutral model, and which we predict to be highly enriched in functional DNA that has been subject to purifying selection with respect to indels. We use the model to determine the proportion under indel-purifying selection to be between 2.56\% and 3.25\% of human euchromatin. Since annotated protein-coding genes comprise only 1.2\% of euchromatin, these results lend further weight to the proposition that more than half the functional complement of the human genome is non-protein-coding. The method is surprisingly powerful at identifying selected sequence using only two or three mammalian genomes. Applying the method to the human, mouse, and dog genomes, we identify 90 Mb of human sequence under indel-purifying selection, at a predicted 10\% false-discovery rate and 75\% sensitivity. As expected, most of the identified sequence represents unannotated material, while the recovered proportions of known protein-coding and microRNA genes closely match the predicted sensitivity of the method. The method's high sensitivity to functional sequence such as microRNAs suggest that as yet unannotated microRNA genes are enriched among the sequences identified. Furthermore, its independence of substitutions allowed us to identify sequence that has been subject to heterogeneous selection, that is, sequence subject to both positive selection with respect to substitutions and purifying selection with respect to indels. The ability to identify elements under heterogeneous selection enables, for the first time, the genome-wide investigation of positive selection on functional elements other than protein-coding genes.},

abstract = {With the advent of genome-wide association (GWA) studies, researchers are hoping that reliable genetic association of common human complex diseases/traits can be detected. Currently, there is an increasing enthusiasm about GWA and a number of GWA studies have been published. In the field a common practice is that replication should be used as the gold standard to validate an association finding. In this article, based on empirical and theoretical data, we emphasize that replication of GWA findings can be quite difficult, and should not always be expected, even when true variants are identified. The probability of replication becomes smaller with the increasing number of independent GWA studies if the power of individual replication studies is less than 100\% (which is usually the case), and even a finding that is replicated may not necessarily be true. We argue that the field may have unreasonably high expectations on success of replication. We also wish to raise the question whether it is sufficient or necessary to treat replication as the ultimate and gold standard for defining true variants. We finally discuss the usefulness of integrating evidence from multiple levels/sources such as genetic epidemiological studies (at the DNA level), gene expression studies (at the RNA level), proteomics (at the protein level), and follow-up molecular and cellular studies for eventual validation and illumination of the functional relevance of the genes uncovered.},

abstract = {Rare individuals have been multiply exposed to HIV-1 but remain uninfected. The CD4+ T-cells of two of these individuals, designated EU2 and EU3, are highly resistant in vitro to the entry of primary macrophagetropic virus but are readily infectable with transformed T-cell line adapted viruses. We report here on the genetic basis of this resistance. We found that EU2 and EU3 have a homozygous defect in CKR-5, the gene encoding the recently described coreceptor for primary HIV-1 isolates. These individuals appear to have inherited a defective CKR-5 allele that contains an internal 32 base pair deletion. The encoded protein is severely truncated and cannot be detected at the cell surface. Surprisingly, this defect has no obvious phenotype in the affected individuals. Thus, a CKR-5 allele present in the human population appears to protect homozygous individuals from sexual transmission of HIV-1. Heterozygous individuals are quite common (approximately 20\%) in some populations. These findings indicate the importance of CKR-5 in HIV-1 transmission and suggest that targeting the HIV-1-CKR-5 interaction may provide a means of preventing or slowing disease progression.},

This issue is addressed directly here using a fitness scheme determined by two genetic loci and a third locus which modifies a measure of statistical interaction between the fitnesses due to the first two. The equilibrium structure of such an epistasis-modifying locus is studied. It is shown that under well-specified conditions a modifying allele that increases epistasis succeeds. In other words, genetic interactions tend to become stronger. It is speculated that this occurs because the mean fitness in such models is locally increasing as a function of the degree of epistasis.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can identify common alleles that contribute to complex disease susceptibility. Despite the large number of SNPs assessed in each study, the effects of most common SNPs must be evaluated indirectly using either genotyped markers or haplotypes thereof as proxies. We have previously implemented a computationally efficient Markov Chain framework for genotype imputation and haplotyping in the freely available MaCH software package. The approach describes sampled chromosomes as mosaics of each other and uses available genotype and shotgun sequence data to estimate unobserved genotypes and haplotypes, together with useful measures of the quality of these estimates. Our approach is already widely used to facilitate comparison of results across studies as well as meta-analyses of GWAS. Here, we use simulations and experimental genotypes to evaluate its accuracy and utility, considering choices of genotyping panels, reference panel configurations, and designs where genotyping is replaced with shotgun sequencing. Importantly, we show that genotype imputation not only facilitates cross study analyses but also increases power of genetic association studies. We show that genotype imputation of common variants using HapMap haplotypes as a reference is very accurate using either genome-wide SNP data or smaller amounts of data typical in fine-mapping studies. Furthermore, we show the approach is applicable in a variety of populations. Finally, we illustrate how association analyses of unobserved variants will benefit from ongoing advances such as larger HapMap reference panels and whole genome shotgun sequencing technologies.},

There are 512 two-locus, two-allele, two-phenotype, fully penetrant disease models. Using the permutation between two alleles, between two loci, and between being affected and unaffected, one model can be considered to be equivalent to another model under the corresponding permutation. These permutations greatly reduce the number of two-locus models in the analysis of complex diseases. This paper determines the number of nonredundant two-locus models (which can be 102, 100, 96, 51, 50, or 58, depending on which permutations are used, and depending on whether zero-locus and single-locus models are excluded). Whenever possible, these nonredundant two-locus models are classified by their property. Besides the familiar features of multiplicative models (logical AND), heterogeneity models (logical OR), and threshold models, new classifications are added or expanded: modifying-effect models, logical XOR models, interference and negative interference models (neither dominant nor recessive), conditionally dominant/recessive models, missing lethal genotype models, and highly symmetric models. The following aspects of two-locus models are studied: the marginal penetrance tables at both loci, the expected joint identity-by-descent (IBD) probabilities, and the correlation between marginal IBD probabilities at the two loci. These studies are useful for linkage analyses using single-locus models while the underlying disease model is two-locus, and for correlation analyses using the linkage signals at different locations obtained by a single-locus model.

Quite often the interactions among genetic variants play major roles in determining the susceptibility of an individual to a particular disease. Statistical methods for modeling interactions underlying complex diseases between single genetic variants (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) have been extensively studied. Recently, haplotype-based analysis has gained its popularity among genetic association studies. When multiple sequence or haplotype interactions are involved in determining an individual's susceptibility to a disease, it presents daunting challenges in statistical modeling and testing of the interaction effects, largely due to the complicated higher order epistatic complexity.},

abstract = {Correlated multiple testing is widely performed in genetic research, particularly in multilocus analyses of complex diseases. Failure to control appropriately for the effect of multiple testing will either result in a flood of false-positive claims or in true hits being overlooked. Cheverud proposed the idea of adjusting correlated tests as if they were independent, according to an 'effective number' (M(eff)) of independent tests. However, our experience has indicated that Cheverud's estimate of the Meff is overly large and will lead to excessively conservative results. We propose a more accurate estimate of the M(eff), and design M(eff)-based procedures to control the experiment-wise significant level and the false discovery rate. In an evaluation, based on both real and simulated data, the M(eff)-based procedures were able to control the error rate accurately and consequently resulted in a power increase, especially in multilocus analyses. The results confirm that the M(eff) is a useful concept in the error-rate control of correlated tests. With its efficiency and accuracy, the M(eff) method provides an alternative to computationally intensive methods such as the permutation test.},

abstract = {Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P < 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10\% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16\% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20\% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways.},

abstract = {The advent of complete genetic linkage maps consisting of codominant DNA markers [typically restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs)] has stimulated interest in the systematic genetic dissection of discrete Mendelian factors underlying quantitative traits in experimental organisms. We describe here a set of analytical methods that modify and extend the classical theory for mapping such quantitative trait loci (QTLs). These include: (i) a method of identifying promising crosses for QTL mapping by exploiting a classical formula of SEWALL WRIGHT; (ii) a method (interval mapping) for exploiting the full power of RFLP linkage maps by adapting the approach of LOD score analysis used in human genetics, to obtain accurate estimates of the genetic location and phenotypic effect of QTLs; and (iii) a method (selective genotyping) that allows a substantial reduction in the number of progeny that need to be scored with the DNA markers. In addition to the exposition of the methods, explicit graphs are provided that allow experimental geneticists to estimate, in any particular case, the number of progeny required to map QTLs underlying a quantitative trait.},

@article{Kreutz1995,
abstract = {
Background An allelic variant of the ACE
gene has been found to be linked to plasma
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity in humans
and has been implicated in the etiology of some common
cardiovascular disorders. Previously, we have shown
significant genetic linkage of blood pressure to a region on rat
chromosome 10 that contains ACE in an experimental
F2-intercross between the stroke-prone spontaneously
hypertensive rat (SHRSPHD) and the normotensive
Wistar-Kyoto (WKYHD-0) reference strain. Subsequent
investigations revealed marked differences in plasma ACE activity among
the SHRSPHD and WKYHD-0 strains. Nonetheless,
the physiological relevance of these findings
remained obscure. We therefore investigated the genetic determination
of plasma ACE activity and its relation to blood pressure and dietary
NaCl exposure in a model of experimental genetic hypertension, the
SHRSPHD. 


Methods and Results We conducted a further crossbreeding
experiment between SHRSPHD and a congenic reference strain,
WKYHD-1, that carries a 6-centimorgan (cM) long,
SHRSP-homologous segment introgressed in chromosome 10, 26 cM remote
from ACE. This allowed us to contrast effects on blood
pressure and ACE activity conferred by the ACE locus with
other more remote loci within the congenic chromosomal region. Genetic
analysis in this F2
(WKYHD-1xSHRSPHD) cross revealed that plasma
ACE activity was determined almost entirely by genetic effects of the
ACE gene locus (lod score=43). However, neither plasma ACE
nor the ACE locus showed any cosegregation with blood
pressure before or after dietary NaCl exposure. 


Conclusions These results demonstrate that a molecular
variant of the ACE gene determines plasma ACE activity but
exhibits no direct effect on blood pressure. Moreover, the findings
also exclude the possibility that plasma ACE is secondarily affected by
blood pressure or excess dietary NaCl exposure. Our results reconcile
the previous discrepancy between findings in human and experimental
hypertension.

The patient cohort included 46 Canadian CF families with well-characterized DNA marker haplotypes spanning the disease locus and several other families from Israel. Eleven mutations were found in the first NBF, 2 were found in the second NBF, but none was found in the R-domain. Seven of the mutations were of the missense type affecting some of the highly conserved amino acid residues in the first NBF; 3 were nonsense mutations; 2 would probably affect mRNA splicing; 2 corresponded to small deletions, including another 3-base-pair deletion different from the major mutation (delta F508), which could account for 70\% of the CF chromosomes in the population. Nine of these mutations accounted for 12 of the 31 non-delta F508 CF chromosomes in the Canadian families. The highly heterogeneous nature of the remaining CF mutations provides important insights into the structure and function of the protein, but it also suggests that DNA-based genetic screening for CF carrier status will not be straightforward.},

abstract = {As a model of variation in a quantitative character, enzyme activity variation segregating in a population is assumed to affect the flux in simple metabolic pathways. The genetic variation of flux is partitioned into additive and nonadditive components. An interaction component of flux variance is present because the effect of an allelic substitution is modified by other substitutions which change the concentrations of shared metabolites. In a haploid population, the the proportion of interaction variance is a function of the gene frequencies at the loci contributing to the flux variation, enzyme activities of mutant and wild type at variable loci and activities at nonvariable loci. The proportion of interaction variance is inversely related to the ratio of mutant to wild-type activities at the loci controlling the enzyme activities. The interaction component as a function of gene frequencies is at a maximum with high mutant allele frequencies. In contrast, the dominance component which would apply to a diploid population is maximal as a proportion of the total when mutant alleles are at low frequencies. Unless there are many loci with large differences in activity between the alleles, the interaction component is a small proportion of the total variance. Data on enzyme activity variation from natural and artificial populations suggest that such variation generates little nonadditive variance despite the highly interactive nature of the underlying biochemical system.},

Based on laboratory evolution experiments and numerical simulations of gene expression dynamics model with an evolving transcription network, we propose quantitative relationships on plasticity, phenotypic fluctuations, and evolvability. By introducing an evolutionary stability assumption on the distribution of phenotype and genotype, the proportionality among phenotypic plasticity against environmental change, variances of phenotype fluctuations of genetic and developmental origins, and evolution speed is obtained. The correlation between developmental robustness to noise and evolutionary robustness to mutation is analysed by simulations of the gene network model. These results provide quantitative formulation on canalization and genetic assimilation, in terms of fluctuations of gene expression levels.},

abstract = {We report a test of the hypothesis that the high frequency of cystic fibrosis (CF) in Caucasian populations is due to a fertility advantage in CF carriers. One hundred forty-three grandparent couples of Utah CF cases were compared with 20 replicate sets of matched control couples drawn from the Utah Genealogical Database. Ascertainment correction, which has not been applied in previous studies of CF carrier fertility, was applied to these data. Before ascertainment correction was applied, CF carriers appeared to manifest a significant fertility advantage over controls. After the correction formula was applied, this difference disappeared. Carriers and controls were also compared in terms of the length of intervals between births. Again, no significant differences were found. It was concluded that fertility differences are unlikely to account for the observed Caucasian CF gene frequency. Other mechanisms, particularly a past selective event or random genetic drift, are more likely to be responsible.},

But, so far, no consensus has emerged on which mutation model should be used, though this is of paramount importance for analysis of population genetic structure. However, this is not surprising given the variety of microsatellite molecular motifs. Null alleles may be disturbing for population studies, even though their presence can be detected through careful population analyses, while homoplasy seems of little concern, at least over short evolutionary scales. Interspecific studies show that microsatellites are poor markers for phylogenetic inference. However, these studies are fuelling discussions on directional mutation and the role of selection and recombination in their evolution. Nonetheless, it remains true that microsatellites may be considered as good, neutral mendelian markers.},

abstract = {Copy number variants (CNVs) contribute to human genetic and phenotypic diversity. However, the distribution of larger CNVs in the general population remains largely unexplored. We identify large variants in approximately 2500 individuals by using Illumina SNP data, with an emphasis on "hotspots" prone to recurrent mutations. We find variants larger than 500 kb in 5\%-10\% of individuals and variants greater than 1 Mb in 1\%-2\%. In contrast to previous studies, we find limited evidence for stratification of CNVs in geographically distinct human populations. Importantly, our sample size permits a robust distinction between truly rare and polymorphic but low-frequency copy number variation. We find that a significant fraction of individual CNVs larger than 100 kb are rare and that both gene density and size are strongly anticorrelated with allele frequency. Thus, although large CNVs commonly exist in normal individuals, which suggests that size alone can not be used as a predictor of pathogenicity, such variation is generally deleterious. Considering these observations, we combine our data with published CNVs from more than 12,000 individuals contrasting control and neurological disease collections. This analysis identifies known disease loci and highlights additional CNVs (e.g., 3q29, 16p12, and 15q25.2) for further investigation. This study provides one of the first analyses of large, rare (0.1\%-1\%) CNVs in the general population, with insights relevant to future analyses of genetic disease.},

abstract = {Lactase persistence, the genetic trait in which intestinal lactase activity persists at childhood levels into adulthood, varies in frequency in different human populations, being most frequent in northern Europeans and certain African and Arabian nomadic tribes, who have a history of drinking fresh milk. Selection is likely to have played an important role in establishing these different frequencies since the development of agricultural pastoralism approximately 9,000 years ago. We have previously shown that the element responsible for the lactase persistence/nonpersistence polymorphism in humans is cis-acting to the lactase gene and that lactase persistence is associated, in Europeans, with the most common 70-kb lactase haplotype, A. We report here a study of the 11-site haplotype in 1,338 chromosomes from 11 populations that differ in lactase persistence frequency. Our data show that haplotype diversity was generated both by point mutations and recombinations. The four globally common haplotypes (A, B, C, and U) are not closely related and have different distributions; the A haplotype is at high frequencies only in northern Europeans, where lactase persistence is common; and the U haplotype is virtually absent from Indo-European populations. Much more diversity is seen in sub-Saharan Africans than in non-Africans, consistent with an "Out of Africa" model for peopling of the Old World. Analysis of recent recombinant haplotypes by allele-specific PCR, along with deduction of the root haplotype from chimpanzee sequence, allowed construction of a haplotype network that assisted in evaluation of the relative roles of drift and selection in establishing the haplotype frequencies in the different populations. We suggest that genetic drift was important in shaping the general pattern of non-African haplotype diversity, with recent directional selection in northern Europeans for the haplotype associated with lactase persistence.},

abstract = {Simulation is an invaluable tool for investigating the effects of various population genetics modeling assumptions on resulting patterns of genetic diversity, and for assessing the performance of statistical techniques, for example those designed to detect and measure the genomic effects of selection. It is also used to investigate the effectiveness of various design options for genetic association studies. Backward-in-time simulation methods are computationally efficient and have become widely used since their introduction in the 1980s. The forward-in-time approach has substantial advantages in terms of accuracy and modeling flexibility, but at greater computational cost. We have developed flexible and efficient simulation software and a rescaling technique to aid computational efficiency that together allow the simulation of sequence-level data over large genomic regions in entire diploid populations under various scenarios for demography, mutation, selection, and recombination, the latter including hotspots and gene conversion. Our forward evolution of genomic regions (FREGENE) software is freely available from www.ebi.ac.uk/projects/BARGEN together with an ancillary program to generate phenotype labels, either binary or quantitative. In this article we discuss limitations of coalescent-based simulation, introduce the rescaling technique that makes large-scale forward-in-time simulation feasible, and demonstrate the utility of various features of FREGENE, many not previously available.},

abstract = {Most common diseases are complex genetic traits, with multiple genetic and environmental components contributing to susceptibility. It has been proposed that common genetic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), influence susceptibility to common disease. This proposal has begun to be tested in numerous studies of association between genetic variation at these common DNA polymorphisms and variation in disease susceptibility. We have performed an extensive review of such association studies. We find that over 600 positive associations between common gene variants and disease have been reported; these associations, if correct, would have tremendous importance for the prevention, prediction, and treatment of most common diseases. However, most reported associations are not robust: of the 166 putative associations which have been studied three or more times, only 6 have been consistently replicated. Interestingly, of the remaining 160 associations, well over half were observed again one or more times. We discuss the possible reasons for this irreproducibility and suggest guidelines for performing and interpreting genetic association studies. In particular, we emphasize the need for caution in drawing conclusions from a single report of an association between a genetic variant and disease susceptibility.},

abstract = {Early-onset parkinsonism (EOP) may be associated with different mutations in the parkin gene, including exon deletions and duplications. To test for gene dosage alterations, we developed a new method of quantitative duplex PCR using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer technique on the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics). In 21 patients with EOP, three mutations (a single base pair substitution in exon 3 and small deletions in exon 9) were detected by conventional mutational screening (single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis), while alterations of gene dosage were found in seven patients. We identified heterozygous and compound heterozygous deletions of exons 2, 3, 5 and 7. The latter was also found in the homozygous state. In addition, two heterozygous duplications of exon 4 were observed. Remarkably, two patients carried more than two parkin mutations. This is the first study systematically screening all 12 exons of parkin by real-time, kinetic quantification and clearly shows that mutational analysis of the parkin gene should include gene dosage studies. Furthermore, our method of quantitative PCR is easily applicable to any other gene to be screened for deletions or duplications of whole exons.},

abstract = {A new technology called genomic selection is revolutionizing dairy cattle breeding. Genomic selection refers to selection decisions based on genomic breeding values (GEBV). The GEBV are calculated as the sum of the effects of dense genetic markers, or haplotypes of these markers, across the entire genome, thereby potentially capturing all the quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to variation in a trait. The QTL effects, inferred from either haplotypes or individual single nucleotide polymorphism markers, are first estimated in a large reference population with phenotypic information. In subsequent generations, only marker information is required to calculate GEBV. The reliability of GEBV predicted in this way has already been evaluated in experiments in the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and the Netherlands. These experiments used reference populations of between 650 and 4,500 progeny-tested Holstein-Friesian bulls, genotyped for approximately 50,000 genome-wide markers. Reliabilities of GEBV for young bulls without progeny test results in the reference population were between 20 and 67\%. The reliability achieved depended on the heritability of the trait evaluated, the number of bulls in the reference population, the statistical method used to estimate the single nucleotide polymorphism effects in the reference population, and the method used to calculate the reliability. A common finding in 3 countries (United States, New Zealand, and Australia) was that a straightforward BLUP method for estimating the marker effects gave reliabilities of GEBV almost as high as more complex methods. The BLUP method is attractive because the only prior information required is the additive genetic variance of the trait. All countries included a polygenic effect (parent average breeding value) in their GEBV calculation. This inclusion is recommended to capture any genetic variance not associated with the markers, and to put some selection pressure on low-frequency QTL that may not be captured by the markers. The reliabilities of GEBV achieved were significantly greater than the reliability of parental average breeding values, the current criteria for selection of bull calves to enter progeny test teams. The increase in reliability is sufficiently high that at least 2 dairy breeding companies are already marketing bull teams for commercial use based on their GEBV only, at 2 yr of age. This strategy should at least double the rate of genetic gain in the dairy industry. Many challenges with genomic selection and its implementation remain, including increasing the accuracy of GEBV, integrating genomic information into national and international genetic evaluations, and managing long-term genetic gain.},

abstract = {Attachment of Ras protein to the membrane, which requires farnesylation at its C terminus, is essential for its biological activity. A promising pharmacological approach of antagonizing oncogenic Ras activity is to develop inhibitors of farnesyltransferase. We use Caenorhabditis elegans vulval differentiation, which is controlled by a Ras-mediated signal transduction pathway, as a model system to test previously identified farnesyltransferase inhibitors. We show here that two farnesyltransferase inhibitors, manumycin and gliotoxin, suppress the Multivulva phenotype resulting from an activated let-60 ras mutation, but not the Multivulva phenotype resulting from mutations in the lin-1 gene or the lin-15 gene, which act downstream and upstream of let-60 ras, respectively, in the signaling pathway. These results are consistent with the idea that the suppression of the Multivulva phenotype of let-60 ras by the two inhibitors is specific for Ras protein and that the mutant Ras protein might be more sensitive than wild-type Ras to the farnesyltransferase inhibitors. This work suggests that C. elegans vulval development could be a simple and effective in vivo system for evaluation of farnesyltransferase inhibitors against Ras-activated tumors.},

@article{Hansen2001,
abstract = {An approximate solution for the mean fitness in mutation-selection balance with arbitrary order of epistatic interaction is derived. The solution is based on the assumptions of coupling equilibrium and that the interaction effects are multilinear. We find that the effect of m-order epistatic interactions (i.e., interactions among groups of m loci) on the load is dependent on the total genomic mutation rate, U, to the mth power. Thus, higher-order gene interactions are potentially important if U is large and the interaction density among loci is not too low. The solution suggests that synergistic epistasis will decrease the mutation load and that variation in epistatic effects will elevate the load. Both of these results, however, are strictly true only if they refer to epistatic interaction strengths measured in the optimal genotype. If gene interactions are measured at mutation-selection equilibrium, only synergistic interactions among even numbers of genes will reduce the load. Odd-ordered synergistic interactions will then elevate the load. There is no systematic relationship between variation in epistasis and load at equilibrium. We argue that empirical estimates of gene interaction must pay attention to the genetic background in which the effects are measured and that it may be advantageous to refer to average interaction intensities as measured in mutation-selection equilibrium. We derive a simple criterion for the strength of epistasis that is necessary to overcome the twofold disadvantage of sex.},

The design yields all information inherent in ordinary twin studies but also permits the simultaneous estimation of more components than any other design. Tests for most genetical and environmental components of variation and the assumptions of the design are provided. Particular advantages are the unambiguous separation of sex-linkage and maternal inheritance, the analysis of the mechanism of assortative mating and the specification of more realistic environmental models. Although several components are confounded the biases are not seriously misleading. However, it would be necessary to include adoption data to resolve the effects of cultural transmission which are otherwise confounded with the family environment. Nevertheless, this design provides a wealth of data on a diversity of relationships and promises to be a valuable tool for the analysis of individual differences in man.},

abstract = {The use of genetic maps based upon molecular markers has allowed the dissection of some of the factors underlying quantitative variation in crosses between inbred lines. For many species crossing inbred lines is not a practical proposition, although crosses between genetically very different outbred lines are possible. Here we develop a least squares method for the analysis of crosses between outbred lines which simultaneously uses information from multiple linked markers. The method is suitable for crosses where the lines may be segregating at marker loci but can be assumed to be fixed for alternative alleles at the major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting the traits under analysis (e.g., crosses between divergent selection lines or breeds with different selection histories). The simultaneous use of multiple markers from a linkage group increases the sensitivity of the test statistic, and thus the power for the detection of QTLs, compared to the use of single markers or markers flanking an interval. The gain is greater for more closely spaced markers and for markers of lower information content. Use of multiple markers can also remove the bias in the estimated position and effect of a QTL which may result when different markers in a linkage group vary in their heterozygosity in the F1 (and thus in their information content) and are considered only singly or a pair at a time. The method is relatively simple to apply so that more complex models can be fitted than is currently possible by maximum likelihood. Thus fixed effects of background genotype can be fitted simultaneously with the exploration of a single linkage group which will increase the power to detect QTLs by reducing the residual variance. More complex models with several QTLs in the same linkage group and two-locus interactions between QTLs can similarly be examined. Thus least squares provides a powerful tool to extend the range of crosses from which QTLs can be dissected whilst at the same time allowing flexible and realistic models to be explored.},

Methods to analyse these data, based on maximum-likelihood, have been developed and provide good estimates of QTL effects in some situations. Maximum-likelihood methods are, however, relatively complex and can be computationally slow. In this paper we develop methods for mapping QTL based on multiple regression which can be applied using any general statistical package. We use the example of mapping in an F(2) population and show that these regression methods produce very similar results to those obtained using maximum likelihood. The relative simplicity of the regression methods means that models with more than a single QTL can be explored and we give examples of two lined loci and of two interacting loci. Other models, for example with more than two QTL, with environmental fixed effects, with between family variance or for threshold traits, could be fitted in a similar way. The ease, speed of application and generality of regression methods for flanking marker analysis, and the good estimates they obtain, suggest that they should provide the method of choice for the analysis of QTL mapping data from inbred line crosses.},

abstract = {Whole genome association studies (WGAS) have surged in popularity in recent years as technological advances have made large-scale genotyping more feasible and as new exciting results offer tremendous hope and optimism. The logic of WGAS rests upon the common disease/common variant (CD/CV) hypothesis. Detection of association under the common disease/rare variant (CD/RV) scenario is much harder, and the current practices of WGAS may be under-power without large enough sample sizes. In this article, we propose a generalized linear model with regularization (rGLM) approach for detecting disease-haplotype association using unphased single nucleotide polymorphisms data that is applicable to both CD/CV and CD/RV scenarios. We borrow a dimension-reduction method from the data mining and statistical learning literature, but use it for the purpose of weeding out haplotypes that are not associated with the disease so that the associated haplotypes, especially those that are rare, can stand out and be accounted for more precisely. By using high-dimensional data analysis techniques, which are frequently employed in microarray analyses, interacting effects among haplotypes in different blocks can be investigated without much concern about the sample size being overwhelmed by the number of haplotype combinations. Our simulation study demonstrates the gain in power for detecting associations with moderate sample sizes. For detecting association under CD/RV, regression type methods such as that implemented in hapassoc may fail to provide coefficient estimates for rare associated haplotypes, resulting in a loss of power compared to rGLM. Furthermore, our results indicate that rGLM can uncover the associated variants much more frequently than can hapassoc.},

abstract = {A comprehensive linkage map of the chicken genome has been developed by segregation analysis of 430 microsatellite markers within a cross between two extreme broiler lines. The population used to construct the linkage map consists of 10 families with a total of 458 F2 individuals. The number of informative meioses per marker varied from 100 to 900 with an average of 400. The markers were placed into 27 autosomal linkage groups and a Z-chromosome-specific linkage group. In addition, 6 markers were unlinked, 1 of which was Z chromosome specific. The coverage within linkage groups is 3062 cM. Although, as in other species, the genetic map of the heterogametic sex (female) is shorter than the genetic map of the homogametic sex (male), the overall difference in length is small (1.15\%). Forty-five of the markers represent identified genes or ESTs. Database homology searches with the anonymous markers resulted in the identification of a further 9 genes, bringing the total number of genes/ESTs on the current map to 54. The mapping of these genes led to the identification of two new regions of conserved synteny between human and chicken and confirmed other previously identified regions of conserved synteny between human and chicken. The linkage map has 210 markers in common with the linkage maps based on the East Lansing and Compton reference populations, and most of the corresponding linkage groups in the different maps can be readily aligned.},

abstract = {Replication has become the gold standard for assessing statistical results from genome-wide association studies. Unfortunately this replication requirement may cause real genetic effects to be missed. A real result can fail to replicate for numerous reasons including inadequate sample size or variability in phenotype definitions across independent samples. In genome-wide association studies the allele frequencies of polymorphisms may differ due to sampling error or population differences. We hypothesize that some statistically significant independent genetic effects may fail to replicate in an independent dataset when allele frequencies differ and the functional polymorphism interacts with one or more other functional polymorphisms. To test this hypothesis, we designed a simulation study in which case-control status was determined by two interacting polymorphisms with heritabilities ranging from 0.025 to 0.4 with replication sample sizes ranging from 400 to 1600 individuals. We show that the power to replicate the statistically significant independent main effect of one polymorphism can drop dramatically with a change of allele frequency of less than 0.1 at a second interacting polymorphism. We also show that differences in allele frequency can result in a reversal of allelic effects where a protective allele becomes a risk factor in replication studies. These results suggest that failure to replicate an independent genetic effect may provide important clues about the complexity of the underlying genetic architecture. We recommend that polymorphisms that fail to replicate be checked for interactions with other polymorphisms, particularly when samples are collected from groups with distinct ethnic backgrounds or different geographic regions.},

abstract = {Functional dependencies between genes are a defining characteristic of gene networks underlying quantitative traits. However, recent studies show that the proportion of the genetic variation that can be attributed to statistical epistasis varies from almost zero to very high. It is thus of fundamental as well as instrumental importance to better understand whether different functional dependency patterns among polymorphic genes give rise to distinct statistical interaction patterns or not. Here we address this issue by combining a quantitative genetic model approach with genotype-phenotype models capable of translating allelic variation and regulatory principles into phenotypic variation at the level of gene expression. We show that gene regulatory networks with and without feedback motifs can exhibit a wide range of possible statistical genetic architectures with regard to both type of effect explaining phenotypic variance and number of apparent loci underlying the observed phenotypic effect. Although all motifs are capable of harboring significant interactions, positive feedback gives rise to higher amounts and more types of statistical epistasis. The results also suggest that the inclusion of statistical interaction terms in genetic models will increase the chance to detect additional QTL as well as functional dependencies between genetic loci over a broad range of regulatory regimes. This article illustrates how statistical genetic methods can fruitfully be combined with nonlinear systems dynamics to elucidate biological issues beyond reach of each methodology in isolation.},

abstract = {Semiparametric procedures for prediction of total genetic value for quantitative traits, which make use of phenotypic and genomic data simultaneously, are presented. The methods focus on the treatment of massive information provided by, e.g., single-nucleotide polymorphisms. It is argued that standard parametric methods for quantitative genetic analysis cannot handle the multiplicity of potential interactions arising in models with, e.g., hundreds of thousands of markers, and that most of the assumptions required for an orthogonal decomposition of variance are violated in artificial and natural populations. This makes nonparametric procedures attractive. Kernel regression and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regression procedures are embedded into standard mixed-effects linear models, retaining additive genetic effects under multivariate normality for operational reasons. Inferential procedures are presented, and some extensions are suggested. An example is presented, illustrating the potential of the methodology. Implementations can be carried out after modification of standard software developed by animal breeders for likelihood-based or Bayesian analysis.},

This article provides a critical review of some theoretical and statistical concepts in the context of genomic-assisted genetic evaluation of animals and crops. First, relationships between the (Bayesian) variance of marker effects in some regression models and additive genetic variance are examined under standard assumptions. Second, the connection between marker genotypes and resemblance between relatives is explored, and linkages between a marker-based model and the infinitesimal model are reviewed. Third, issues associated with the use of Bayesian models for marker-assisted selection, with a focus on the role of the priors, are examined from a theoretical angle. The sensitivity of a Bayesian specification that has been proposed (called "Bayes A") with respect to priors is illustrated with a simulation. Methods that can solve potential shortcomings of some of these Bayesian regression procedures are discussed briefly.},

abstract = {Multiple testing is a challenging issue in genetic association studies using large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, many of which exhibit linkage disequilibrium (LD). Failure to adjust for multiple testing appropriately may produce excessive false positives or overlook true positive signals. The Bonferroni method of adjusting for multiple comparisons is easy to compute, but is well known to be conservative in the presence of LD. On the other hand, permutation-based corrections can correctly account for LD among SNPs, but are computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a new multiple testing correction method for association studies using SNP markers. We show that it is simple, fast and more accurate than the recently developed methods and is comparable to permutation-based corrections using both simulated and real data. We also demonstrate how it might be used in whole-genome association studies to control type I error. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method make it an attractive choice for multiple testing adjustment when there is high intermarker LD in the SNP data set.},

abstract = {Modern genomewide association studies are characterized by the problem of "missing heritability." Epistasis, or genetic interaction, has been suggested as a possible explanation for the relatively small contribution of single significant associations to the fraction of variance explained. Of particular concern to investigators of genetic interactions is how to best represent and define epistasis. Previous studies have found that the use of different quantitative definitions for genetic interaction can lead to different conclusions when constructing genetic interaction networks and when addressing evolutionary questions. We suggest that instead, multiple representations of epistasis, or epistatic "subtypes," may be valid within a given system. Selecting among these epistatic subtypes may provide additional insight into the biological and functional relationships among pairs of genes. In this study, we propose maximum-likelihood and model selection methods in a hypothesis-testing framework to choose epistatic subtypes that best represent functional relationships for pairs of genes on the basis of fitness data from both single and double mutants in haploid systems. We gauge the performance of our method with extensive simulations under various interaction scenarios. Our approach performs reasonably well in detecting the most likely epistatic subtype for pairs of genes, as well as in reducing bias when estimating the epistatic parameter (epsilon). We apply our approach to two available data sets from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and demonstrate through overlap of our identified epistatic pairs with experimentally verified interactions and functional links that our results are likely of biological significance in understanding interaction mechanisms. We anticipate that our method will improve detection of epistatic interactions and will help to unravel the mysteries of complex biological systems.},

abstract = {Three common protein isoforms of apolipoprotein E (apoE), encoded by the epsilon2, epsilon3, and epsilon4 alleles of the APOE gene, differ in their association with cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease risk. To gain a better understanding of the genetic variation underlying this important polymorphism, we identified sequence haplotype variation in 5.5 kb of genomic DNA encompassing the whole of the APOE locus and adjoining flanking regions in 96 individuals from four populations: blacks from Jackson, MS (n=48 chromosomes), Mayans from Campeche, Mexico (n=48), Finns from North Karelia, Finland (n=48), and non-Hispanic whites from Rochester, MN (n=48). In the region sequenced, 23 sites varied (21 single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, 1 diallelic indel, and 1 multiallelic indel). The 22 diallelic sites defined 31 distinct haplotypes in the sample. The estimate of nucleotide diversity (site-specific heterozygosity) for the locus was 0.0005+/-0.0003. Sequence analysis of the chimpanzee APOE gene showed that it was most closely related to human epsilon4-type haplotypes, differing from the human consensus sequence at 67 synonymous (54 substitutions and 13 indels) and 9 nonsynonymous fixed positions. The evolutionary history of allelic divergence within humans was inferred from the pattern of haplotype relationships. This analysis suggests that haplotypes defining the epsilon3 and epsilon2 alleles are derived from the ancestral epsilon4s and that the epsilon3 group of haplotypes have increased in frequency, relative to epsilon4s, in the past 200,000 years. Substantial heterogeneity exists within all three classes of sequence haplotypes, and there are important interpopulation differences in the sequence variation underlying the protein isoforms that may be relevant to interpreting conflicting reports of phenotypic associations with variation in the common protein isoforms.},

abstract = {We describe the Phase II HapMap, which characterizes over 3.1 million human single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in 270 individuals from four geographically diverse populations and includes 25-35\% of common SNP variation in the populations surveyed. The map is estimated to capture untyped common variation with an average maximum r2 of between 0.9 and 0.96 depending on population. We demonstrate that the current generation of commercial genome-wide genotyping products captures common Phase II SNPs with an average maximum r2 of up to 0.8 in African and up to 0.95 in non-African populations, and that potential gains in power in association studies can be obtained through imputation. These data also reveal novel aspects of the structure of linkage disequilibrium. We show that 10-30\% of pairs of individuals within a population share at least one region of extended genetic identity arising from recent ancestry and that up to 1\% of all common variants are untaggable, primarily because they lie within recombination hotspots. We show that recombination rates vary systematically around genes and between genes of different function. Finally, we demonstrate increased differentiation at non-synonymous, compared to synonymous, SNPs, resulting from systematic differences in the strength or efficacy of natural selection between populations.},

abstract = {Genome scan mapping experiments involve multiple tests of significance. Thus, controlling the error rate in such experiments is important. Simple extension of classical concepts results in attempts to control the genomewise error rate (GWER), i.e., the probability of even a single false positive among all tests. This results in very stringent comparisonwise error rates (CWER) and, consequently, low experimental power. We here present an approach based on controlling the proportion of false positives (PFP) among all positive test results. The CWER needed to attain a desired PFP level does not depend on the correlation among the tests or on the number of tests as in other approaches. To estimate the PFP it is necessary to estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses. Here we show how this can be estimated directly from experimental results. The PFP approach is similar to the false discovery rate (FDR) and positive false discovery rate (pFDR) approaches. For a fixed CWER, we have estimated PFP, FDR, pFDR, and GWER through simulation under a variety of models to illustrate practical and philosophical similarities and differences among the methods.},

abstract = {A model is investigated in which mutations that affect a complex trait (e.g., heart disease) also affect fitness because the trait is a component of fitness or because the mutations have pleiotropic effects on fitness. The model predicts that the genetic variance, and hence the heritability, in the trait is contributed by mutations at low frequency in the population, unless the mean strength of selection of mutations that affect the trait is very small or weakly selected mutations tend to contribute disproportionately to the trait compared with strongly selected mutations. Furthermore, it is shown that each rare mutation tends to contribute more to the variance than each common mutation. These results may explain why most genome-wide association studies have failed to find associations that explain much of the variance. It is also shown that most of the variance in fitness contributed by new nonsynonymous mutations is caused by mutations at very low frequency in the population. This implies that most low-frequency SNPs, which are observed in current resequencing studies of, for example, 100 chromosomes, probably have little impact on the variance in fitness or traits. Finally, it is shown that the variance contributed by a category of mutations (e.g., coding or regulatory) depends largely upon the mean strength of selection; this has implications for understanding which types of mutations are likely to be responsible for the variance in fitness and inherited disease.},

abstract = {The current paradigm within genetic diagnostics is to test individuals only at loci known to affect risk of complex disease-yet the technology exists to genotype an individual at thousands of loci across the genome. We investigated whether information from genome-wide association studies could be harnessed to improve discrimination of complex disease affection status. We employed genome-wide data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium to test this hypothesis. Each disease cohort together with the same set of controls were split into two samples-a 'Training Set', where thousands of SNPs that might predispose to disease risk were identified and a 'Prediction Set', where the discriminatory ability of these SNPs was assessed. Genome-wide scores consisting of, for example, the total number of risk alleles an individual carries was calculated for each individual in the prediction set. Case-control status was regressed on this score and the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) estimated. In most cases, a liberal inclusion of SNPs in the genome-wide score improved AUC compared with a more stringent selection of top SNPs, but did not perform as well as selection based upon established variants. The addition of genome-wide scores to known variant information produced only a limited increase in discriminative accuracy but was most effective for bipolar disorder, coronary heart disease and type II diabetes. We conclude that this small increase in discriminative accuracy is unlikely to be of diagnostic or predictive utility at the present time.},

abstract = {Studies in model organisms suggest that epistasis may play an important role in the etiology of complex diseases and traits in humans. With the era of large-scale genome-wide association studies fast approaching, it is important to quantify whether it will be possible to detect interacting loci using realistic sample sizes in humans and to what extent undetected epistasis will adversely affect power to detect association when single-locus approaches are employed. We therefore investigated the power to detect association for an extensive range of two-locus quantitative trait models that incorporated varying degrees of epistasis. We compared the power to detect association using a single-locus model that ignored interaction effects, a full two-locus model that allowed for interactions, and, most important, two two-stage strategies whereby a subset of loci initially identified using single-locus tests were analyzed using the full two-locus model. Despite the penalty introduced by multiple testing, fitting the full two-locus model performed better than single-locus tests for many of the situations considered, particularly when compared with attempts to detect both individual loci. Using a two-stage strategy reduced the computational burden associated with performing an exhaustive two-locus search across the genome but was not as powerful as the exhaustive search when loci interacted. Two-stage approaches also increased the risk of missing interacting loci that contributed little effect at the margins. Based on our extensive simulations, our results suggest that an exhaustive search involving all pairwise combinations of markers across the genome might provide a useful complement to single-locus scans in identifying interacting loci that contribute to moderate proportions of the phenotypic variance.},

We demonstrate how the phenotypic covariance between related individuals provides information on the relative importance of genetic and environmental factors influencing that trait, and how factors such as assortative mating, gene-environment correlation and genotype-environment interaction complicate such interpretations. Twin and adoption studies are discussed as well as their assumptions and limitations. Structural equation modeling (SEM) is introduced and we illustrate how this approach may be applied to genetic problems. In particular, we show how SEM can be used to address complicated issues such as analyzing the causes of correlation between traits or determining the direction of causation (DOC) between variables.},

Clades of haplotypes are tested for association with disease, exploiting the expected similarity of chromosomes with recent shared ancestry in the region flanking the disease gene. The method is developed in a logistic-regression framework and can easily incorporate covariates such as environmental risk factors or additional unlinked loci to allow for population structure. To evaluate the power of this approach to detect disease-marker association, we have developed a simulation algorithm to generate high-density SNP data with short-range linkage disequilibrium based on empirical patterns of haplotype diversity. The results of the simulation study highlight substantial gains in power over single-locus tests for a wide range of disease models, despite overcorrection for multiple testing.},

abstract = {The question of what significance threshold is appropriate for genomewide association studies is somewhat unresolved. Previous theoretical suggestions have yet to be validated in practice, whereas permutation testing does not resolve a discrepancy between the genomewide multiplicity of the experiment and the subset of markers actually tested. We used genotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium to estimate a genomewide significance threshold for the UK Caucasian population. We subsampled the genotypes at increasing densities, using permutation to estimate the nominal P-value for 5\% family-wise error. By extrapolating to infinite density, we estimated the genomewide significance threshold to be about 7.2 x 10(-8). To reduce the computation time, we considered Patterson's eigenvalue estimator of the effective number of tests, but found it to be an order of magnitude too low for multiplicity correction. However, by fitting a Beta distribution to the minimum P-value from permutation replicates, we showed that the effective number is a useful heuristic and suggest that its estimation in this context is an open problem. We conclude that permutation is still needed to obtain genomewide significance thresholds, but with subsampling, extrapolation and estimation of an effective number of tests, the threshold can be standardized for all studies of the same population.},

abstract = {Layered on top of information conveyed by DNA sequence and chromatin are higher order structures that encompass portions of chromosomes, entire chromosomes, and even whole genomes. Interphase chromosomes are not positioned randomly within the nucleus, but instead adopt preferred conformations. Disparate DNA elements co-localize into functionally defined aggregates or 'factories' for transcription and DNA replication. In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome.},

@article{Doerge1996,
abstract = {The problem of detecting minor quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for genetic variation not explained by major QTL is of importance in the complete dissection of quantitative characters. Two extensions of the permutation-based method for estimating empirical threshold values are presented. These methods, the conditional empirical threshold (CET) and the residual empirical threshold (RET), yield critical values that can be used to construct tests for the presence of minor QTL effects while accounting for effects of known major QTL. The CET provides a completely nonparametric test through conditioning on markers linked to major QTL. It allows for general nonadditive interactions among QTL, but its practical application is restricted to regions of the genome that are unlinked to the major QTL. The RET assumes a structural model for the effect of major QTL, and a threshold is constructed using residuals from this structural model. The search space for minor QTL is unrestricted, and RET-based tests may be more powerful than the CET-based test when the structural model is approximately true.},

Genomic BAC clones from the critical interval were transferred into transgenic mice to functionally complement the Lgn1-associated susceptibility of A/J mice to L. pneumophila. Here we report that two independent BAC clones that rescue susceptibility have an overlapping region of 56 kb in which the entire Lgn1 transcript must lie. The only known full-length transcript coded in this region is Birc1e (also called Naip5).},

Biological information is typically considered as being transmitted across generations by the DNA sequence alone, but accumulating evidence indicates that both genetic and non-genetic inheritance, and the interactions between them, have important effects on evolutionary outcomes. We review the evidence for such effects of epigenetic, ecological and cultural inheritance and parental effects, and outline methods that quantify the relative contributions of genetic and non-genetic heritability to the transmission of phenotypic variation across generations. These issues have implications for diverse areas, from the question of missing heritability in human complex-trait genetics to the basis of major evolutionary transitions.},

abstract = {Molecular heterosis occurs when subjects heterozygous for a specific genetic polymorphism show a significantly greater effect (positive heterosis) or lesser effect (negative heterosis) for a quantitative or dichotomous trait than subjects homozygous for either allele. At a molecular level heterosis appears counterintuitive to the expectation that if the 1 allele of a two-allele polymorphism is associated with a decrease in gene expression, those carrying the 11 genotype should show the greatest effect, 12 heterozygotes should be intermediate, and 22 homozygotes should show the least effect. We review the accumulating evidence that molecular heterosis is common in humans and may occur in up to 50\% of all gene associations. A number of examples are reviewed, including those for the following genes: ADRA2C, C3 complement, DRD1, DRD2, DRD3, DRD4, ESR1, HP, HBB, HLA-DR DQ, HTR2A, properdin B, SLC6A4, PNMT, and secretor. Several examples are given in which the heterosis is gender-specific. Three explanations for molecular heterosis are proposed. The first is based on an inverted U-shaped response curve in which either to little or too much gene expression is deleterious, with optimal gene expression occurring in 12 heterozygotes. The second proposes an independent third factor causing a hidden stratification of the sample such that for in one set of subjects 11 homozygosity is associated with the highest phenotype score, while in the other set, 22 homozygosity is associated with the highest phenotype score. The third explanation suggests greater fitness in 12 heterozygotes because they show a broader range of gene expression than 11 or 22 homozygotes. Allele-based linkage techniques usually miss heterotic associations. Because up to 50\% of association studies show a heterosis effect, this can significantly diminish the power of family-based linkage and association studies.},

abstract = {Human geneticists working on systems for which it is possible to make a strong case for a set of candidate genes face the problem of whether it is necessary to consider the variation in those genes as phased haplotypes, or whether the one-SNP-at-a-time approach might perform as well. There are three reasons why the phased haplotype route should be an improvement. First, the protein products of the candidate genes occur in polypeptide chains whose folding and other properties may depend on particular combinations of amino acids. Second, population genetic principles show us that variation in populations is inherently structured into haplotypes. Third, the statistical power of association tests with phased data is likely to be improved because of the reduction in dimension. However, in reality it takes a great deal of extra work to obtain valid haplotype phase information, and inferred phase information may simply compound the errors. In addition, if the causal connection between SNPs and a phenotype is truly driven by just a single SNP, then the haplotype-based approach may perform worse than the one-SNP-at-a-time approach. Here we examine some of the factors that affect haplotype patterns in genes, how haplotypes may be inferred, and how haplotypes have been useful in the context of testing association between candidate genes and complex traits.},

abstract = {Allelic variation in 9.7 kb of genomic DNA sequence from the human lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL) was scored in 71 healthy individuals (142 chromosomes) from three populations: African Americans (24) from Jackson, MS; Finns (24) from North Karelia, Finland; and non-Hispanic Whites (23) from Rochester, MN. The sequences had a total of 88 variable sites, with a nucleotide diversity (site-specific heterozygosity) of .002+/-.001 across this 9.7-kb region. The frequency spectrum of nucleotide variation exhibited a slight excess of heterozygosity, but, in general, the data fit expectations of the infinite-sites model of mutation and genetic drift. Allele-specific PCR helped resolve linkage phases, and a total of 88 distinct haplotypes were identified. For 1,410 (64\%) of the 2,211 site pairs, all four possible gametes were present in these haplotypes, reflecting a rich history of past recombination. Despite the strong evidence for recombination, extensive linkage disequilibrium was observed. The number of haplotypes generally is much greater than the number expected under the infinite-sites model, but there was sufficient multisite linkage disequilibrium to reveal two major clades, which appear to be very old. Variation in this region of LPL may depart from the variation expected under a simple, neutral model, owing to complex historical patterns of population founding, drift, selection, and recombination. These data suggest that the design and interpretation of disease-association studies may not be as straightforward as often is assumed.},

abstract = {The detection of genes that control quantitative characters is a problem of great interest to the genetic mapping community. Methods for locating these quantitative trait loci (QTL) relative to maps of genetic markers are now widely used. This paper addresses an issue common to all QTL mapping methods, that of determining an appropriate threshold value for declaring significant QTL effects. An empirical method is described, based on the concept of a permutation test, for estimating threshold values that are tailored to the experimental data at hand. The method is demonstrated using two real data sets derived from F(2) and recombinant inbred plant populations. An example using simulated data from a backcross design illustrates the effect of marker density on threshold values.},

The heterozygous mouse exhibited a well-circumscribed syndrome of behavioral abnormalities, consisting primarily of a decreased fear response and an increase in defensive aggression, in the absence of any measured cognitive deficits. Unlike the heterozygote, the homozygote displayed abnormal behavior in all paradigms tested. At the cellular level, both extracellular and whole-cell patch clamp recordings indicated that serotonin release in putative serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe was reduced. Thus, alpha-CaMKII knockout mice, in particular the heterozygote, may provide a model for studying the molecular and cellular basis underlying emotional disorders involving fear and aggression.},

abstract = {We have constructed haplotypes based on normal variation at six polymorphic sites-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one short tandem repeat polymorphism (STRP)-at the RET locus for samples of normal individuals from 32 populations distributed across the major continental regions of the world. The haplotyped system spans 41.6 kilobases and encompasses most of the coding region of the gene. All of the markers are polymorphic in all regions of the world and in most individual populations. Expected heterozygosities for the six-site haplotypes range from 82 to 94\% for all populations studied except for two Amerindian groups from the Amazon basin at 61 and 76\%. Individual populations had from four to eight haplotypes with frequencies exceeding 5\%. In general, African, southwest Asian and European groups have the highest numbers of total and of commonly occurring haplotypes; the lowest numbers are observed in Amerindian populations. Overall linkage disequilibrium (LD) for the five SNP sites was very significant (P</=0.001) for all the non-African populations, but significant at that level for only one of the seven African populations. In general, the permutation-based xi coefficient that quantifies overall LD tends to increase the farther the population is from Africa, but variability of this measure of LD is often large within geographic regions. Pairwise LD measures among the SNPs also show considerable variation among populations. Association of STRP alleles with the SNP-defined background haplotypes is generally higher outside of Africa than in Africa, but is highly variable.},

abstract = {There is an increasing role of population genetics in human genetic research linking empirical observations with hypotheses about sequence variation due to historical and evolutionary causes. In addition, the data sets are increasing in size, with genome-wide data becoming a common place in many empirical studies. As far as more information is available, it becomes clear that simplest hypotheses are not consistent with data. Simulations will provide the key tool to contrast complex hypotheses on real data by generating simulated data under the hypothetical historical and evolutionary conditions that we want to contrast. Undoubtedly, developing tools for simulating large sequences that at the same time allow simulate natural selection, recombination and complex demography patterns will be of great interest in order to better understanding the trace left on the DNA by different interacting evolutionary forces. Simulation tools will be also essential to evaluate the sampling properties of any statistics used on genome-wide association studies and to compare performance of methods applied at genome-wide scales. Several recent simulation tools have been developed. Here, we review some of the currently existing simulators which allow for efficient simulation of large sequences on complex evolutionary scenarios. In addition, we will point out future directions in this field which are already a key part of the current research in evolutionary biology and it seems that it will be a primary tool in the future research of genome and post-genomic biology.},

abstract = {It has been argued that the architecture of the genotype-phenotype map determines evolvability, but few studies have attempted to quantify these effects. In this article we use the multilinear epistatic model to study the effects of different forms of epistasis on the response to directional selection. We derive an analytical prediction for the change in the additive genetic variance, and use individual-based simulations to understand the dynamics of evolvability and the evolution of genetic architecture. This shows that the major determinant for the evolution of the additive variance, and thus the evolvability, is directional epistasis. Positive directional epistasis leads to an acceleration of evolvability, while negative directional epistasis leads to canalization. In contrast, pure non-directional epistasis has little effect on the response to selection. One consequence of this is that the classical epistatic variance components, which do not distinguish directional and non-directional effects, are useless as predictors of evolutionary dynamics. The build-up of linkage disequilibrium also has negligible effects. We argue that directional epistasis is likely to have major effects on evolutionary dynamics and should be the focus of empirical studies of epistasis.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have rapidly become a standard method for disease gene discovery. A substantial number of recent GWAS indicate that for most disorders, only a few common variants are implicated and the associated SNPs explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the GWAS provide preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence, and that these secondary analyses are very likely to provide valuable information that will help prioritize the strongest constellations of results. We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary GWAS statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations. Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data are unavailable. Testing for epistasis within a single GWAS study can identify the stronger results that are revealed when genes interact. Pathway analysis of GWAS results is used to prioritize genes and pathways within a biological context. Following a GWAS, association results can be assigned to pathways and tested in aggregate with computational tools and pathway databases. Reviews of published methods with recommendations for their application are provided within the framework for each approach.},

We measured mRNA expression levels in purified HSCs isolated from a panel of densely genotyped recombinant inbred mouse strains. We mapped quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with variation in expression of thousands of transcripts. By comparing the physical transcript position with the location of the controlling QTL, we identified polymorphic cis-acting stem cell genes. We also identified multiple trans-acting control loci that modify expression of large numbers of genes. These groups of coregulated transcripts identify pathways that specify variation in stem cells. We illustrate this concept with the identification of candidate genes involved with HSC turnover. We compared expression QTLs in HSCs and brain from the same mice and identified both shared and tissue-specific QTLs. Our data are accessible through WebQTL, a web-based interface that allows custom genetic linkage analysis and identification of coregulated transcripts.},

The approach is based on the fitting of variable-length Markov chain models, which automatically adapt to the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers to create a parsimonious model for the LD structure. Edges of the fitted graph are tested for association with trait status. This approach can be thought of as haplotype testing with sophisticated windowing that accounts for extent of LD to reduce degrees of freedom and number of tests while maximizing information. I present analyses of two published data sets that show that this approach can have better power than single-marker tests or sliding-window haplotypic tests.},

We use realistic simulations to explore the statistical properties of the method, and show that for ungenotyped disease-susceptibility variants with population frequencies of 5\% or less the haplotypic tests have markedly better power than single-marker tests. We propose a combined single-marker and haplotypic strategy, in which both single-marker and haplotypic tests are applied, with the minimum P-value adjusted for multiple testing by permutation which results in a test that is powerful for detecting both low-and high-frequency disease-susceptibility variants.

abstract = {The Darwinian explanation for evolution is that it is the outcome of the interaction between genetic variation and natural selection. There is now good evidence for both the existence of genetic variation and the occurrence of natural selection, the latter potentially at high intensities. The outcome should be rapid evolutionary change; yet in practice very little change is found. Most species are very stable, and in situations where evolution is observed in one species often none is found in others despite equivalent opportunity. Evolutionary failure is commonplace. Despite the occurrence of high levels of protein polymorphism, there is good evidence that the supply of variation making a major contribution to fitness is very limited. As a result it is argued that lack of evolution in most species may be due more to lack of appropriate variability than to other causes: a condition for which the term 'genostasis' is proposed. In those situations where appropriate genetic variation is available for one reason or another, evolution is found to be very rapid. There are good theoretical and practical reasons for more attention being paid to the mechanisms of supply of new variation and to those situations where evolution appears not be taking place.},

The basic principle of the mapping scheme is to develop, by recombinant DNA techniques, random single-copy DNA probes capable of detecting DNA sequence polymorphisms, when hybridized to restriction digests of an individual's DNA. Each of these probes will define a locus. Loci can be expanded or contracted to include more or less polymorphism by further application of recombinant DNA technology. Suitably polymorphic loci can be tested for linkage relationships in human pedigrees by established methods; and loci can be arranged into linkage groups to form a true genetic map of "DNA marker loci." Pedigrees in which inherited traits are known to be segregating can then be analyzed, making possible the mapping of the gene(s) responsible for the trait with respect to the DNA marker loci, without requiring direct access to a specified gene's DNA. For inherited diseases mapped in this way, linked DNA marker loci can be used predictively for genetic counseling.},

abstract = {Interaction between genetic variants is hypothesized to be one of several putative explanations for the 'case of missing heritability.' Therefore, Genome-Wide Interaction Analysis (GWIA) has recently gained substantial interest. GWIA is computationally challenging and respective power type I error studies are particularly difficult. Therefore, an accepted significance level for GWIA studies does not currently exist. It has been shown that for a GWAS single-marker analysis with n SNPs a correction for multiple testing with 1/2 · n is appropriate for populations of European ancestry. We speculated that for GWIA, correction by 1/4 · m should be appropriate, where m = n · (n- 1)/2 is the number of SNP pairs. We tried to verify this hypothesis using the INTERSNP program that implements interaction analysis and genome-wide Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation. Using a type I error study based on Illumina(®) HumanHap 550 data, we were able to reproduce the published result for single-marker analysis. For GWIA using a test for allelic interaction, we show that correction with roughly 0.4 · m is appropriate, a number that is somewhat larger than that of our hypothesis. In summary, it can be stated that for an Illumina(®) -type marker panel with 500,000 SNPs, an uncorrected P-value of 1.0 × 10⁻¹² is needed to establish genome-wide significance at the 0.05 level.},

Now, the abundance of genetic markers has made it possible to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL)--the regions of a chromosome or, ideally, individual sequence variants that are responsible for trait variation. What kind of QTL do we expect to find and what can our observations of QTL tell us about how organisms evolve? The key to understanding the evolutionary significance of QTL is to understand the nature of inherited variation, not in the immediate mechanistic sense of how genes influence phenotype, but, rather, to know what evolutionary forces maintain genetic variability.},

abstract = {For pedigree-based quantitative trait loci (QTL) association analysis, a range of methods utilizing within-family variation such as transmission-disequilibrium test (TDT)-based methods have been developed. In scenarios where stratification is not a concern, methods exploiting between-family variation in addition to within-family variation, such as the measured genotype (MG) approach, have greater power. Application of MG methods can be computationally demanding (especially for large pedigrees), making genomewide scans practically infeasible. Here we suggest a novel approach for genomewide pedigree-based quantitative trait loci (QTL) association analysis: genomewide rapid association using mixed model and regression (GRAMMAR). The method first obtains residuals adjusted for family effects and subsequently analyzes the association between these residuals and genetic polymorphisms using rapid least-squares methods. At the final step, the selected polymorphisms may be followed up with the full measured genotype (MG) analysis. In a simulation study, we compared type 1 error, power, and operational characteristics of the proposed method with those of MG and TDT-based approaches. For moderately heritable (30\%) traits in human pedigrees the power of the GRAMMAR and the MG approaches is similar and is much higher than that of TDT-based approaches. When using tabulated thresholds, the proposed method is less powerful than MG for very high heritabilities and pedigrees including large sibships like those observed in livestock pedigrees. However, there is little or no difference in empirical power of MG and the proposed method. In any scenario, GRAMMAR is much faster than MG and enables rapid analysis of hundreds of thousands of markers.},

We have investigated the genome-wide profile of structural variation on pooled samples from the three populations studied in the HapMap project by comparative genome hybridization (CGH) in different array platforms. We have identified and experimentally validated 33 genomic loci that show significant copy number differences from one population to the other. Interestingly, we found an enrichment of genes related to environment adaptation (immune response, lipid metabolism and extracellular space) within these regions and the study of expression data revealed that more than half of the copy number variants (CNVs) translate into gene-expression differences among populations, suggesting that they could have functional consequences. In addition, the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are in linkage disequilibrium with the copy number alleles allowed us to detect evidences of population differentiation and recent selection at the nucleotide variation level.



Overall, our results provide a comprehensive view of relevant copy number changes that might play a role in phenotypic differences among major human populations, and generate a list of interesting candidates for future studies.},

abstract = {Interaction between genes, or epistasis, is found to be common and it is a key concept for understanding adaptation and evolution of natural populations, response to selection in breeding programs, and determination of complex disease. Currently, two independent classes of models are used to study epistasis. Statistical models focus on maintaining desired statistical properties for detection and estimation of genetic effects and for the decomposition of genetic variance using average effects of allele substitutions in populations as parameters. Functional models focus on the evolutionary consequences of the attributes of the genotype-phenotype map using natural effects of allele substitutions as parameters. Here we provide a new, general and unified model framework: the natural and orthogonal interactions (NOIA) model. NOIA implements tools for transforming genetic effects measured in one population to the ones of other populations (e.g., between two experimental designs for QTL) and parameters of statistical and functional epistasis into each other (thus enabling us to obtain functional estimates of QTL), as demonstrated numerically. We develop graphical interpretations of functional and statistical models as regressions of the genotypic values on the gene content, which illustrates the difference between the models--the constraint on the slope of the functional regression--and when the models are equivalent. Furthermore, we use our theoretical foundations to conceptually clarify functional and statistical epistasis, discuss the advantages of NOIA over previous theory, and stress the importance of linking functional and statistical models.},

Here, we use a two-locus genetic system in simulated populations with epistasis to show the convenience of using a recently developed model, NOIA, to perform estimates of genetic effects and the decomposition of the genetic variance that are orthogonal even under deviations from the Hardy-Weinberg proportions. We develop the theory for how to use this model in interval mapping of quantitative trait loci using Halley-Knott regressions, and we analyze a real data set to illustrate the advantage of using this approach in practice. In this example, we show that departures from the Hardy-Weinberg proportions that are expected by sampling alone substantially alter the orthogonal estimates of genetic effects when other statistical models, like F2 or G2A, are used instead of NOIA. Finally, for the first time from real data, we provide estimates of functional genetic effects as sets of effects of natural allele substitutions in a particular genotype, which enriches the debate on the interpretation of genetic effects as implemented both in functional and in statistical models. We also discuss further implementations leading to a completely general genotype-phenotype map.},
